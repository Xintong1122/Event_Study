1. What's the average amount of gas used for a single-hop swap? 
2. Does a two-hops swap consume double the amount of gas as a single-hop swap? My gut feeling tells me that a two-hops swap doesn't require double the amount of a single-hop swap, but I'm not sure what could be the gas needed wrt a single-hop swap on average in % terms. 

Anyone who could shed some light on this, please?",,,,,
4.71358E+17,crypto_rachel,2022-09-01T14:02:46.6280000-04:00,"I'd say a rough average would be like 150k -200k
a multi hop swap will not be double, but it will add cost as each token will have work that comes with it, like transfers and checks, All tokens will consume a variable in gas as each token has it's own work to do

```gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org```

Is it a valid strategy to provide V3 LPs in like a tiny range which then gets updated like every 5 mins, using a bot etc?

So for example the price right now of ETH is $1565 and I make a LP pair with range being from $1555 - $1575 and then every 5 mins the price gets updated and it'll make another pair $10 up and $10 down? you get  great fees. I would also only do this on a sidechain where you wouldnt have to worry about gas

I would also only do this during ""stable"" market conditions, where price action is only really moving horizontally. Has this been tried before? Can anyone see a floor, apart from the obvious risk of impermanent loss",,,,,

If you want to correct the spot price, the spot price changes only during swapping. You need to do a swap to correct the price and then add liquidity.

is that if a fork occurs, the two networks will split off into different universes - both sides will respect their (shared) history BEFORE the split but will not care at all about what happens on the other chain after the split. So if you have tokens before the fork, you will have two sets of tokens - one on each chain. and what you do with those tokens will not affect the other set of tokens. There will not be any ongoing mirroring of actions after the fork. 

As a practical matter I do not think that a PoW fork will exist for very long and I do not think the value of tokens on that chain will be relevant.",,üëÜ (2),,,

Uniswap has something kinda like a range order, but not usually the way users would want to
this is done with a very small range Lq position that would convert to the opposite token at a certain price
but take example of eth / usdc
placing a small range order as price raising from x eth per usdc you will end up with USDC not Weth as price is rising and opposite as price falls

UNI Allocation

1 billion UNI have been minted at genesis and will become accessible over the course of 4 years. The initial four year allocation is as follows:

60.00% to Uniswap community members 600,000,000 UNI

21.266% to team members and future employees with 4-year vesting 212,660,000 UNI

18.044% to investors with 4-year vesting 180,440,000 UNI

0.69% to advisors with 4-year vesting 6,900,000 UNI

A perpetual inflation rate of 2% per year will start after 4 years, ensuring continued participation and contribution to Uniswap at the expense of passive UNI holders.

A Retrospective

Uniswap owes its success to the thousands of community members that have joined its journey over the past two years. These early community members will naturally serve as responsible stewards of Uniswap.

15% of UNI 150,000,000 UNI can immediately be claimed by historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders based on a snapshot ending September 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC.

4.91664% pro-rata to all 49,192 historical LPs 49,166,400 UNI

~49 million UNI are claimable by historical liquidity providers. The formula accounts for LP liquidity on a per-second basis since the deployment of Uniswap v1, ensuring that rewards are weighted towards LPs that provided liquidity when total liquidity was low.

10.06136% split evenly across all 251,534 historical user addresses 100,613,600 UNI

400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes ~12,000 addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions ‚Ä?love you guys.

0.022% to 220 SOCKS holders/redeemers 220,000 UNI

1000 UNI are claimable by each address that has either redeemed SOCKS tokens for physical socks or owned at least one SOCKS token at the snapshot date.```",,,,,

6.50052E+17,tacobeast_,2022-09-28T21:46:14.8560000-04:00,"Ok, I just read through all the docs and entered my first LP position to test everything.  I wanted to confirm everything works like I think it does before I move over a much larger position:  Is the following accurate?

1. If the price of either goes 'out of range' nothing happens except that I will no longer receive swap fees.  At that point if I removed my LP position while out of range I would have 100% of the tokens in the one that lost or gained the most value depending on which direction it went?
2. If the price re-entered the range, it would then automatically begin collecting fees again?
3. If I removed my LP position while out of range what is the value of the LP?  For example if I start an LP with Token1 and Token2 of $100 each and Token2 goes up to $200 and Token1 stays at $100 and this puts the tokens OUT OF RANGE and I choose to withdraw the LP, I would have $300 (less impermanent loss) of Token1 (the less valuable token)?",,,,,

2. Yes
3. About right though with regards to the figures, you might need to use an 3rd party tool calc to estimate the IL. You can check here #üîó‚îÇhelpful-links  or ask other LP here #ü§ù‚îÇliquidity-providers on tools they are using",,,,,

Basically, the idea is that lots of great content get created by the community but become hard to find. So, the site helps projects curate content as a community all in one place as it isnt dependent on one person to do everything. At the same time, it should make it easier for newcomers to learn more. 

So, each project can set their own admins/mods and control what gets posted on their page. I already added some content to the uni page but definitely missing a lot of stuff. Would love to hear if you've got any feedback or questions. Ideally the community would love the site, start adding content and take over ownership of the page from me. 

There's also a discord bot that integrates with the Q&A section, so hopefully less time can get spent on routine support. Example gif is for curve but would work the same with any questions added to the uniswap page.",,Uni (2),,,

9.89275E+17,anthonynicholas.,2022-10-29T20:18:06.8950000-04:00,How is moonbeam different from other chains?,,,,,
8.22201E+17,turrizt,2022-10-30T00:01:37.6570000-04:00,"Moonbeam is an EVM compatible parachain on Polkadot. Moonbeam is built using Rust and the Substrate framework, enabling rich tools for implementation, but also allowing for specialization and optimization. Moonbeam allows users to interact with:
EVM comptible / Polkadot / Dotsama + Cosmos ecosystem chains.

in general, the main goal of Moonbeam is to connect a ton of different chains and become an advanced place to build dapps, that is, developers will be able to build dApps, where, in turn, users will be able to interact with a large number of different assets in one place, that is, the main goal is to create the most convenient product for both developers and users.  

the Moonbeam team is currently working on a new milestone and is a pioneer in the field of so-called connected contracts. one of the use cases is a one-click swap, without having to look for bridges and so on. 

connected contracts refer to the cooperation of smart contracts on the ‚Äúbackend‚Ä?of the DApps users interact with on the blockchain. These contracts are connected across blockchains so there is no need to bridge assets in order to use assets in any application, on any connected chain. Moonbeam based connected contracts can use different messaging transports to send messages to other chains. XCM, Axelar, LayerZero, Hyperlane. once Chainlink CCIP is available i expect it will be available as a messaging transport as well.

Moonbeam founder Derek talked about all the advantages of Moonbeam in his speech at Polkadot Decoded:

It states that 60% of the tokens (600M UNI) where destined towards the community. Upon further reading, it also states that 15% (150M UNI) where promptly claimable in the airdrop, and that 43% (430M UNI) where destined to the treasury.

I have a question.
I tried to set fee when user trade tokens (for example swap token A to B).
In that case, first user approve his A token to router then router call transferFrom function.
So I got this on transfer function on token  contract.
Then I reduce the fee from the transfer amount (token A) and send the remain amount to the pool
So the pool received Amount - fee.
But at the end of the trade, the pool send the original amount of token B (according to the original amount of A, not amount - fee).
I researched the uniswap contracts.
Uniswap doesn't calculate the return amount with the real received token amount.
It used the input amount on uniswap interface.(the uniswap interface used the swapExactTokensForTokens)",,,,,

My name is Erden Karso and I currently work at Cyber Capital as a researcher. I am writing my master's thesis on whether incentive designs and voting mechanisms within DAOs or traditional/public companies are more efficient and effective at mitigating agency problems.

I am searching for active contributors within DAOs to interview. DAOs are a relatively new concept that needs more (academic) research and I will try my best to make sure that this research adds value to the crypto space and DAOs. The agency problem is a conflict of interest that occurs when agents (e.g. managers) don't fully represent the best interests of principals (e.g. shareholders/owners). In DAOs, the members are both the principal and the agent.

Are some of you interested to help make research literature less outdated? Interviews will be around 30min only. Please let me know.

Thank you for your time.",,,,,

There are no ""gems"" in that collection. I asked which NFT the ""Genie:Gem NFT"" refers to.

""This tier is also available to wallets that purchased a Genie:Genesis NFT or a Genie:Gem NFT between 5:59 pm and 9:15 pm UTC on June 21st.""
-- I assume Genie:Gem NFT refers to The Genie's Lamp from the Yat Gems collection.

The time range for eligibility corresponds _exactly_ to these tweets: <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539306971899351040> <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539356280212553728>

You can see that the price of the Genie's Lamp NFT (i.e. Genie:Gem NFT) was 0.1 ETH before the news and was likely pumped by misinformation and still selling for 0.3 ETH about a day later. The price did not *return* to pre-misinformation levels until sometime the next day (on OpenSea, specifically). Yet the eligibility requirements between and end strictly when the tweets were made (a 3 hour range). Some Genie:Gem NFT *holders* were also affected by this mishap as they chose to continue holding their Genie:Gem NFT (and chose not to sell into the news immediately). The same could possibly be said about the Genie:Genesis NFTs. [Misinformation included which NFTs were eligible (Genie:Genesis & Genie:Gem) and the snapshot date for holders.]

There are 76+2 Genie:Genesis NFTs. I assume all were included in the snapshot for April 15th.
And there are 69 Genie:Gem NFTs. At least a few were made eligible for the airdrop because they were ""bought"" during that 3 hour window on Jun 21st. It's a 5 million USDC airdrop; I estimate the airdrop fund would have increased by 1% if every holder had been made eligible. Why couldn't holders of this relatively small collection also have been made eligible (e.g. before the first tweet)? Or the buyers who bought the Genie:Gem NFT slightly after the 3 hour-window (a day later), paying an inflated price? It seems it also took the price of the Genie:Genesis NFT about a day to return to pre-misinformation levels -- not 3 hours. There is one sale of the Genesis collection on OpenSea 20-minutes outside of the eligibility window that I think was clearly inflated by misinformation (as the prices dropped a day later): <https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd1d7d54f709f1b1ec62f8459e1c8f706e745d55c8fb7a98c9c78da1ae0cbb978>

I do not think increasing the 5_000_000 budget by ~50_000 would have been unreasonable, and would have encompassed more parties affected by the misinformation mishap. (I just think a 1% increase is a relatively minor increase for this airdrop.)

I conclude misinformation is what pumped the prices of these NFTs for up to 24 hours, and that the 3-hour eligibility window was not adequately long.
Genie:Gem and Genie:Genesis aren't collection names nor are they the title of the NFTs (as far as I know). It would be helpful to refer to the specific NFTs or collections. __There is NO ""Gem"" NFT under the Genie.xyz collection__(0xc466e2F98f95CC4Cde31B134906f59E8264c1BE0)

In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap bridge. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

As implied in the name, bridges allow one to easily migrate tokens from one chain to another. 

For example converting from Ethereum to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo you will need to have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees when converting. Similarly user should be able to migrate from the different chains supported by Uniswap

For this we would be creating separate tab in the home page of Uniswap.

Example use case
To switch between Ethereum and Arbitrum:
Click on the ""Bridge"" tab, and select ""Arbitrum Bridge"":

This will take you to the Arbitrum Token Bridge, where you can connect your wallet and ""deposit/withdraw"" tokens to and from the Arbitrum network.

Conclusion
Uniswap as community together we can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance decentralization of financial services. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.",,,,,

I really do not understand what part of that calculation is not clear.  These fees are simply distributed to the liquidity providers calculating the amount of their participation and their limiting range.  And nothing more is needed than dividing the total liquidity by the fees generated and then multiplying by 365 (THIS GIVES THE APR BASED ON THE LAST 24 HOURS WHICH IS ONLY VALID FOR THOSE LAST 24 HOURS)",,,,,

I have a question, perhaps for developers, that many tax professionals are struggling with. Who owns the Tokens in any given liquidity pool? Language  in v2 documents indicate that the LP token is a representation of the tokens owned my the holder. But other language indicating a transfer of ownership exists in v3 documents. I know the tokens are moved to the smart contract balance but, in the eyes of the developer, does that amount to a change of ownership? This answer can have significant tax impacts and perhaps a proposal to provide clarifications to the documentation would help ensure proper tax treatment.  Right now tax authorities can essentially argue both ways, whichever leads to more tax. Thanks",,,,,

I saw these two sentences in two separate CoinDesk articles: ""Uniswap, for instance, earns fees and pays returns to UNI token holders but doesn‚Äôt have revenues, Qureshi said."" https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/10/dragonflys-haseeb-qureshi-is-still-optimistic-in-the-crypto-bear-market/  ""could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap‚Äôs native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.""  https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/11/first-mover-asia-uniswap-fee-switch-proposal-for-popular-ether-pools-stirs-up-community-debate/  Now, it's been a long time since there have been any farms for Uniswap.  But there were no farms back in 6/22 nor 11/22 when these articles were written, right?  Further that's still not the same thing as ""paying returns to UNI token holders"" or ""rewards for holders of Uniswap's native token UNI.""  That suggests just holding the token means you get some kind of profit share.  I mean, some fees get stored in some treasury, I believe, and having UNI can help you vote on how to spend that treasury, I believe, but that is not the same thing as saying if I have 2 UNI vs someone who has 1 UNI, I have twice as many ""rewards"" accrual power.  I mean 2 or 1 UNI is barely any power at all in governance, but the /only/ direct value I know of comes from selling it to others who, when combined in large amounts (millions of UNI, for example) can, say, accomplish something that might pull the funds from that treasury.

We just go to the Uniswap UI and then just select the pool pair that we want to remove liquidity. In your case yesterday, when you tried to remove your LP pair APEFI-ETH from the pool. It did not show up right? Sometimes this things happen. That is why we have workaround for this and that link we provided will automatically load your pool. I cannot explain the why in details but that is the logic behind it.",,,,,

Lets say I set my LP USDC/ETH from 900 to 1500 and I deposit there $1000. As price is reaching the 900, all my LP is converted to ETH, so, if the price drops under my range, in this case 900, I have there only ETH and I am loosing my value of $1000 due to price of ETH. 
And as price is reaching 1500, my LP is converted to USDC, so if the price goes over 1500, I have only my value I deposited in USDC, so still $1000?

I just want to confirm that the ""tick"" field in this table is the ending tick of the trade. I went ahead and assumed this and used the previous swap's end_tick as the starting tick for the current swap and was able to determine the ticks that each swap went through. This is where I ran into some confusion, shouldn't all ETH for USDC swaps move the tick in the same direction (in this case: start tick >= end tick) and vice versa? I did not find this to be the case so does that mean something in my computations went wrong or this there a case where a ETH for USDC swap can result in a situation where the end tick > start tick?",,,,,

If you remove your liquidity the fees will also be included, not like in V3 where it is not autocompounded and you have to manually/separately claim it. You can also refer to the response below regarding the major difference between v2 and v3. You can also check the resources available in #üìå‚îÇfaq-troubleshooting about V3.

I'm all for censorship resistance, but if you can't transact both ways in a Uni-LP, seems awfully silly to not do something about that contract.
Can I issue a proposal to change this behaviour?",,,,,

Anyway, you can ask in #üíª‚îÇdev-chat if it's even possible for the contract to detect ALL ways how scam tokens are coded and if there is a solution, you can do a proposal in https://gov.uniswap.org/ with regards to its implementation

Alternatively, you can check#üê∂‚îÇscam-token-guide  for guidance before participating in activities related to those tokens. Additionally, if you do not wish to conduct your own research as stated when importing the custom tokens, it may be advisable to refrain from engaging with those tokens at all.",,,,,

But, tbh, I would never have thought there would be a contract on Uni where I couldn't swap in or out.  My previous understanding of scam tokens is that they'll create an LP, find ways to manipulate a pump and then rug the stable coin side of the LP, leaving others with valueless tokens.  I didn't expect a contract on UNI that wouldn't be swappable in a given direction.",,,,,

3.18001E+17,crablegs5818,2023-01-17T22:00:06.0490000-05:00,"As for solutions to this, one simple one would be if a contract is found unswappable in both tokens, to at least delist it from the platform and ideally take over the pool.  I guess that introduces other vulnerabilities and ""governance"" but if the contract verifiably cannot swap in both directions, I cannot think of a case where an honest actor would be harmed if Uni were able to seize the contract.",,,,,
4.27327E+17,la1210,2023-01-17T22:02:28.1670000-05:00,Not a dev but I really doubt if it would be simple to identify if a token is unswappable since there are mutliple ways to do it so. Feel free to have it discussed in #üíª‚îÇdev-chat for the possibility. Best thing you could do for now is to DYOR and check these tokens individually. #üê∂‚îÇscam-token-guide will help you a lot,,üëç (1),,,

Than tried to bridge them via metamask bridge to bnb chain but metamask does not even find metavpad (0x62858686119135cc00C4A3102b436a0eB314D402)  and does not allow to give it manually data.

1.) Multihop swaps :- I am trying to do multihop swaps using alpha router as per the docs here
https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v3/guides/routing . If i try and calculate route for multihop swaps , it is working for mainnet but not with tokens i built on testnet. Is there anything i am missing. Please help.

2.) Uniswap v3 graphql :- I want to integrate uniswap v3 for polygon . As per the docs i got a graphql url to fetch position data , pool data etc but i think its for ethereum mainnet only. Can someone point me to a graphql url for mumbai testnet and polygon?  I found this url but it is missing queries for pool and many more things https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/messari/uniswap-v3-polygon.  Can anyone point me to a functioning url ?

bc you could still over time underperform if you hit the bounds too fast and too often so your LP has no time to cover the losses from the rebalancing
ie if you set the ranges like from 0.05 to 0.10 and yo start at 0.075 in my understanding you would either sell on average btc at 0.0875 or buy eth at 0.0625.
if you now rebalance at 0.10 in first case you pay more for the btc to get it back, that you previously sold for eth and vice versa
so, as I said above, if you hit the ranges too fast, your collected fees won't probably cover the rebalancing loss.",,üëç (2),,,
