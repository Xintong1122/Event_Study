8.79451E+17,ricapillz,2022-09-08T20:57:51.7870000-04:00,ok i guess i cant post scanner links but basically the question is that they have almost 2B USDC and almost 5B USDT (BSC-USD) on BSC. you can look up the scanner links urself as i cannot share them. however i don't see these amounts of USDC and USDT in Binance's wallets on ethereum,,,,,,,,
8.79451E+17,ricapillz,2022-09-08T20:58:13.9740000-04:00,which means both tokens are in bad debt and at risk of being undercollateralized on BSC??,,,,,,,,
8.79451E+17,ricapillz,2022-09-08T20:59:32.4880000-04:00,i'm not sure what I am missing so if there is a wallet address I am missing of Binance that holds these amounts of these tokens on Ethereum please send me the address. I summed up the amounts in the different binance wallets and they still didn't add up to that much,,,,,,,,
8.79451E+17,ricapillz,2022-09-08T21:00:02.7690000-04:00,they do have a lot of extra BUSD tho so are they using BUSD to collateralize the USDC and USDT they mint on BSC?,,,,,,,,

The BNB Auto-Burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter. This offers greater transparency and predictability to the BNB community.
BNB lost in eligible cases can also be reimbursed through the BNB Pioneer Burn Program. This counts users' lost coins towards the official burn count and reimburses them with BNB.

I deposited usdc via arbitrum to my binance wallet, and it didn't happen successfully. I already contacted binance support, but each agent says something different, one said that it was not possible to recover, and the other said that it was but that I would have to pay a fee of 500 BUSD, given that my transaction it was 670 USDC, I would lose 75% of the amount with the fee alone. I would like to know if it is possible to recover the tokens in another way. I know it was my mistake since binance doesn't accept USDC deposit via arbitrum, but I believe there's another way to solve it",,,,,,,,

I see a lot of retail traders panicking when price goes down then selling.  Don't let your emotions take charge.  Do a lot of research, stay up to date, and weigh the risks and rewards of your financial decisions.  Don't over-leverage (just ask FTX).",,,,,,,,

The owner of FTX had a 10% stake in Solana and may have to liquidate.  Also, about $1 billion in staked Solana is becoming unstakable today.  People are concerned that with the market hurting how it is, that that would mean a huge selloff.  A lot of people trying to sell first before the potential sale of the staked Sol.  They may or may not sell-  Also, the US election is making people uncertain of who will create crypto regulation.  Lot of factors at play, but that's the jist of it from what I see.",,,,,,,,

Both can be leveraged, which means you increase your trading volume by that factor. It also means you'll narrow the margin as to when your trade will default in liquidation, which is a total loss. To avoid total loss, you can set Stop-loss prices at which your assets will be automatically sold (still a loss but not a complete one).
In both cases you're able to add liquidity to push your margin in which you want to trade.

Long: bet on rising prices - sell higher than you bought it for
Short: bet on falling prices - sell lower than you bought it for",,,,,,,,

I have a  general question that I been debating with my friend for a while now so he told me that in P2P transaction if I contact a seller about buying a certain amount then in the middle of talking to the seller I decide I wanna cancel the deal no money sent no nothing just I decide to back off the deal. do I get banned coz I backed out of a deal? coz that just seems not logical to me nothing happend I just contacted a seller didn't workout between us so I backed out so why would I get banned or suspended for nothing happening besides me contacting the seller,,,,,,,,

üåüBinance Gift Card :
Many of us already had experienced Amazon Gift Card, where we can redeem a gift card for ordering anything, we can gift anyone, The Binance gift card concept is also same, Let's see what the Binance Gift card is :
At Binance Gift card you can easily put your desire assets into a unique coupon code, if any one redeem that code, will get exact same quantity assets what you had added, sender or recipient both don't have to pay any charges !
Redeemation process is almost instant & your assets will also added to your funding wallet instantly.

üåüWhere can we redeem those Gift cards :
You can send gift card via email / text messages/ Binance account.
Both Binance app & Binance web has the facility, so don't worry about it üôÇ

üåüGift Card No vs Gift Card Code :
Well many of us confused & doing this common mistake, at redeemation page they put gift card no & become frustrated, actually gift card no is just a serial no of a gift card, you can't redeem the gift card by this, you have to put gift card code, which will also be highlighted at gmail/ message also, read carefully the manuals, don't worry about it üôÇ

üåüSecurity :
When you're sending gift cards there is a chance that gift card maybe redeem by someone else, so their is a solution, you can bind a gmail id with that gift card, only that particular Gmail Id binded binance account will get access of those gift cards, your gift card will not misuse by anyone.",,üî• (1),,,,,,

And people are paid for free

I have seen many riches by coming to this Binance

And people are very helpful 

This is on Binance

I have never seen such a platform in my life

I want this platform to go further

And everyone should support this platform

 Consider every little detail.
 You do, since no one is waiting,
 Then joy will come to you.
 Happiness brought by fate will rush,
 You will be amazed, the world has suddenly become different.
 Share more often with a radiant smile,
 Then the universe will suddenly become pure.
 Let evil go, good riddance
 And you don't have to worry anymore.
 And you do not live under someone's phonogram,
 Plan your great program.
 Find the good, run deeper roots
 Forward, bold, active and persistent!
 Let mirages flash in the mirror
 Hold luck by the tail.

 Increase your budget wisely",,,,,,,,

 Do you lack happiness, joy again?
 Yeah better get up on the right foot
 And turn your steps.
 In the direction where there is more proc,
 After all, life gives us important lessons.
 And from the first day, do everything wrong,
 Consider every little detail.
 You do, since no one is waiting,
 Then joy will come to you.
 Happiness brought by fate will rush,
 You will be amazed, the world has suddenly become different.
 Share more often with a radiant smile,
 Then the universe will suddenly become pure.
 Let evil go, good riddance
 And you don't have to worry anymore.
 And you do not live under someone's phonogram,
 Plan your great program.
 Find the good, run deeper roots
 Forward, bold, active and persistent!
 Let mirages flash in the mirror
 Hold luck by the tail.
 Put on a bulletproof vest from adversity,
 Increase your budget wisely .
 Merry Christmas ‚õÑüé?,"",""

This year has been a hectic one,it has been a roller coaster ride!  We've been through many ups and downs
To some it was a wonderful experience and to some a wild one, we gained money and we lost money too, lost friends,burned nights just studying the market, experienced market crashes and scams,we laughed together and cried together this year will go down in history for the sake of records...so many happenings made some fall by the way, some lost their way,but here we are strong and united...its that time of the year to encourage and celebrate ourselves for the victories we've won and the battles we've lost.... it's that time of the year we sit and laugh about the past event, its the time of the year to brace up for more.... it's the time to celebrate Christmas in the binance way....

Keep it carefully in the heart,

Be glad, don't be proud,

I have hedge trade open (1 long position, and 1 short position).

For each of the 2 positions, I am being charged a Funding Fee, as usual.

But some fees are positive and some are negative (they have a minus sign in front).

That's because for a position(long or short) I'm being charged(as a finding fee), and for the other position(short or long) I receive money(as a funding fee).

But I don't know which is which. Is the negative finding fee for the short? Or for the long?",,,,,,,,

3.91668E+17,zollat,2023-01-10T11:09:26.8310000-05:00,so I found this site that mines TRX and I thought its sketchy at first ( ik cloud mining exist but it didn't look like a legit one) I found their transaction history and they are paying 4kTRX 8kTRX to other wallets now when I go check the other wallet ( the one that received) I always find it empty and its transaction history always sending to other wallets 0.0000001 Trx and its hundred of them so I thought is it trying to hide in between them now I found when they sent the whole 8k Trx transaction and it was in an other empty wallet thats also empty and sending 0.000001 trx to other different wallets so now I'm thinking is it like all a scam that's just trying to hide the transaction where it's actually all a loop and faking the transaction in it,,,,,,,,

Creating a Binance Gift Card only takes a few simple steps.

You might be thinking of how you'll convince your best friend to join the crypto world. Give them a push by sending them a Binance gift card. 

It can be a $10 or if you want to put more pressure, send a $100 gift card. How to do that?

Click on the link below to start creating Binance gift cards for your family and loved ones.

 You can insert your referral link into gift card email to easily refer non-Binance friends for referral commissions.

They'll love you for it. 

PS: A non-Binance user will need to create a Binance account to redeem their gift card.

Once a new IEO is announced, a snapshot is taken of potential investors‚Ä?BNB holdings over a set period that varies according to the sale. After the BNB holding period, a claim ticket button will appear for 24 hours to users which need to confirm their lottery tickets, after which the lottery will start and the winners will automatically allow users to become participants of the IEO in exchange for BNB tokens. How many tokens investors can keep depends on how much was committed overall, and is subject to individual caps.""  Binance uses this lottery system to ensure that all the tokens that are offered reach as many people as reasonably possible.
