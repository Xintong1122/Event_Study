9.89E+17,anthonynicholas.,2022-10-29T20:18:06.8950000-04:00,How is moonbeam different from other chains?,,,,,
8.22E+17,turrizt,2022-10-30T00:01:37.6570000-04:00,"Moonbeam is an EVM compatible parachain on Polkadot. Moonbeam is built using Rust and the Substrate framework, enabling rich tools for implementation, but also allowing for specialization and optimization. Moonbeam allows users to interact with:
EVM comptible / Polkadot / Dotsama + Cosmos ecosystem chains.

in general, the main goal of Moonbeam is to connect a ton of different chains and become an advanced place to build dapps, that is, developers will be able to build dApps, where, in turn, users will be able to interact with a large number of different assets in one place, that is, the main goal is to create the most convenient product for both developers and users.  

the Moonbeam team is currently working on a new milestone and is a pioneer in the field of so-called connected contracts. one of the use cases is a one-click swap, without having to look for bridges and so on. 

connected contracts refer to the cooperation of smart contracts on the ‚Äúbackend‚Ä?of the DApps users interact with on the blockchain. These contracts are connected across blockchains so there is no need to bridge assets in order to use assets in any application, on any connected chain. Moonbeam based connected contracts can use different messaging transports to send messages to other chains. XCM, Axelar, LayerZero, Hyperlane. once Chainlink CCIP is available i expect it will be available as a messaging transport as well.

Moonbeam founder Derek talked about all the advantages of Moonbeam in his speech at Polkadot Decoded:

It states that 60% of the tokens (600M UNI) where destined towards the community.

I have a question.
I tried to set fee when user trade tokens (for example swap token A to B).
In that case, first user approve his A token to router then router call transferFrom function.
So I got this on transfer function on token  contract.
Then I reduce the fee from the transfer amount (token A) and send the remain amount to the pool
So the pool received Amount - fee.
But at the end of the trade, the pool send the original amount of token B (according to the original amount of A, not amount - fee).
I researched the uniswap contracts.
Uniswap doesn't calculate the return amount with the real received token amount.
It used the input amount on uniswap interface.(the uniswap interface used the swapExactTokensForTokens)",,,,,

My name is Erden Karso and I currently work at Cyber Capital as a researcher. I am writing my master's thesis on whether incentive designs and voting mechanisms within DAOs or traditional/public companies are more efficient and effective at mitigating agency problems.

I am searching for active contributors within DAOs to interview. DAOs are a relatively new concept that needs more (academic) research and I will try my best to make sure that this research adds value to the crypto space and DAOs. The agency problem is a conflict of interest that occurs when agents (e.g. managers) don't fully represent the best interests of principals (e.g. shareholders/owners). In DAOs, the members are both the principal and the agent.

Are some of you interested to help make research literature less outdated? Interviews will be around 30min only. Please let me know.

Thank you for your time.",,,,,

2.79E+17,mushini,2022-12-01T14:40:07.9310000-05:00,"You mean the Genie.xyz collection?
There are no ""gems"" in that collection. I asked which NFT the ""Genie:Gem NFT"" refers to.

""This tier is also available to wallets that purchased a Genie:Genesis NFT or a Genie:Gem NFT between 5:59 pm and 9:15 pm UTC on June 21st.""
-- I assume Genie:Gem NFT refers to The Genie's Lamp from the Yat Gems collection.

The time range for eligibility corresponds _exactly_ to these tweets: <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539306971899351040> <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539356280212553728>

You can see that the price of the Genie's Lamp NFT (i.e. Genie:Gem NFT) was 0.1 ETH before the news and was likely pumped by misinformation and still selling for 0.3 ETH about a day later. The price did not *return* to pre-misinformation levels until sometime the next day (on OpenSea, specifically). Yet the eligibility requirements between and end strictly when the tweets were made (a 3 hour range). Some Genie:Gem NFT *holders* were also affected by this mishap as they chose to continue holding their Genie:Gem NFT (and chose not to sell into the news immediately). The same could possibly be said about the Genie:Genesis NFTs. [Misinformation included which NFTs were eligible (Genie:Genesis & Genie:Gem) and the snapshot date for holders.]

There are 76+2 Genie:Genesis NFTs. I assume all were included in the snapshot for April 15th.
And there are 69 Genie:Gem NFTs. At least a few were made eligible for the airdrop because they were ""bought"" during that 3 hour window on Jun 21st. It's a 5 million USDC airdrop; I estimate the airdrop fund would have increased by 1% if every holder had been made eligible. Why couldn't holders of this relatively small collection also have been made eligible (e.g. before the first tweet)? Or the buyers who bought the Genie:Gem NFT slightly after the 3 hour-window (a day later), paying an inflated price? It seems it also took the price of the Genie:Genesis NFT about a day to return to pre-misinformation levels -- not 3 hours. There is one sale of the Genesis collection on OpenSea 20-minutes outside of the eligibility window that I think was clearly inflated by misinformation (as the prices dropped a day later): <https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd1d7d54f709f1b1ec62f8459e1c8f706e745d55c8fb7a98c9c78da1ae0cbb978>

I do not think increasing the 5_000_000 budget by ~50_000 would have been unreasonable, and would have encompassed more parties affected by the misinformation mishap. (I just think a 1% increase is a relatively minor increase for this airdrop.)

I conclude misinformation is what pumped the prices of these NFTs for up to 24 hours, and that the 3-hour eligibility window was not adequately long.
Genie:Gem and Genie:Genesis aren't collection names nor are they the title of the NFTs (as far as I know). It would be helpful to refer to the specific NFTs or collections. __There is NO ""Gem"" NFT under the Genie.xyz collection__(0xc466e2F98f95CC4Cde31B134906f59E8264c1BE0)

In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap bridge. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

As implied in the name, bridges allow one to easily migrate tokens from one chain to another. 

For example converting from Ethereum to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo you will need to have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees when converting. Similarly user should be able to migrate from the different chains supported by Uniswap

For this we would be creating separate tab in the home page of Uniswap.

Example use case
To switch between Ethereum and Arbitrum:
Click on the ""Bridge"" tab, and select ""Arbitrum Bridge"":

This will take you to the Arbitrum Token Bridge, where you can connect your wallet and ""deposit/withdraw"" tokens to and from the Arbitrum network.

Conclusion
Uniswap as community together we can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance decentralization of financial services. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.",,,,,

I have a question, perhaps for developers, that many tax professionals are struggling with. Who owns the Tokens in any given liquidity pool? Language  in v2 documents indicate that the LP token is a representation of the tokens owned my the holder. But other language indicating a transfer of ownership exists in v3 documents. I know the tokens are moved to the smart contract balance but, in the eyes of the developer, does that amount to a change of ownership? This answer can have significant tax impacts and perhaps a proposal to provide clarifications to the documentation would help ensure proper tax treatment.  Right now tax authorities can essentially argue both ways, whichever leads to more tax. Thanks",,,,,

1. No Minimum Fee - Payment processors often charge a minimum fee regardless of purchase size. Our minimum fees are zero!
2. No Spread on USDC - Payment processors quote a slightly higher token price than the market rate. This fee is called a ""spread"" and contributes to their margins. We have zero spread for USDC purchases!

""We have some of the lowest in the entire market:
1. No Minimum Fee - Payment processors often charge a minimum fee regardless of purchase size. Our minimum fees are zero!
2. No Spread on USDC - Payment processors quote a slightly higher token price than the market rate. This fee is called a ""spread"" and contributes to their margins. We have zero spread for USDC purchases!
3. Low spread and processing fees - We've also negotiated low spread and processing fees on all supported currencies.""",,,,,

I saw these two sentences in two separate CoinDesk articles: ""Uniswap, for instance, earns fees and pays returns to UNI token holders but doesn‚Äôt have revenues, Qureshi said."" https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/10/dragonflys-haseeb-qureshi-is-still-optimistic-in-the-crypto-bear-market/  ""could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap‚Äôs native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.""  https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/11/first-mover-asia-uniswap-fee-switch-proposal-for-popular-ether-pools-stirs-up-community-debate/  Now, it's been a long time since there have been any farms for Uniswap.  But there were no farms back in 6/22 nor 11/22 when these articles were written, right?  Further that's still not the same thing as ""paying returns to UNI token holders"" or ""rewards for holders of Uniswap's native token UNI.""  That suggests just holding the token means you get some kind of profit share.  I mean, some fees get stored in some treasury, I believe, and having UNI can help you vote on how to spend that treasury, I believe, but that is not the same thing as saying if I have 2 UNI vs someone who has 1 UNI, I have twice as many ""rewards"" accrual power.  I mean 2 or 1 UNI is barely any power at all in governance, but the /only/ direct value I know of comes from selling it to others who, when combined in large amounts (millions of UNI, for example) can, say, accomplish something that might pull the funds from that treasury.

How can I solve the problem of inconsistency between the getOutputAmount calculated using v3-sdk and using quoter?

Another way to ask: just like the Uniswap V2 algorithm, I get the reserves data from the chain once and can calculate getOutputAmount offline based on this data without having to deal with the network every time, the same goes for Uniswap V3, is there a way to get the data when I can do the offline calculation countless times to get the result of getOutputAmount?

Lets say I set my LP USDC/ETH from 900 to 1500 and I deposit there $1000. As price is reaching the 900, all my LP is converted to ETH, so, if the price drops under my range, in this case 900, I have there only ETH and I am loosing my value of $1000 due to price of ETH. 
And as price is reaching 1500, my LP is converted to USDC, so if the price goes over 1500, I have only my value I deposited in USDC, so still $1000?
Do I understand this correctly,  or can somebody explain this on this case for me?",,,,,

I just want to confirm that the ""tick"" field in this table is the ending tick of the trade. I went ahead and assumed this and used the previous swap's end_tick as the starting tick for the current swap and was able to determine the ticks that each swap went through. This is where I ran into some confusion, shouldn't all ETH for USDC swaps move the tick in the same direction (in this case: start tick >= end tick) and vice versa?

How can this happen? Am I doing something wrong? GMX-WETH is the biggest pool in Uni v3! 
Is there a way to import a better list?

Make sure to search using the token contract address instead of a name to ensure that you're swapping for the right token.

If you remove your liquidity the fees will also be included, not like in V3 where it is not autocompounded and you have to manually/separately claim it. You can also refer to the response below regarding the major difference between v2 and v3. You can also check the resources available in #üìå‚îÇfaq-troubleshooting about V3.

bc you could still over time underperform if you hit the bounds too fast and too often so your LP has no time to cover the losses from the rebalancing
ie if you set the ranges like from 0.05 to 0.10 and yo start at 0.075 in my understanding you would either sell on average btc at 0.0875 or buy eth at 0.0625.
if you now rebalance at 0.10 in first case you pay more for the btc to get it back, that you previously sold for eth and vice versa
so, as I said above, if you hit the ranges too fast, your collected fees won't probably cover the rebalancing loss.",,üëç (2),,,

Ensure that Metamask is updated to version 10.5.2 or above.
Chrome users can manually force an update by going to Manage extensions > Developer mode > Update

Ensure that Ledger Live is closed otherwise it might prevent your Ledger device from connecting to Metamask.

Open the Ethereum (ETH) app on your Ledger device before clicking the ""Connect Hardware Wallet"" button in Metamask.

Ensure that your Ledger device runs the latest firmware version.
Ensure that your Ledger device is running the latest version of the Ethereum (ETH) app.
Ensure that blind signing is enabled in the Ethereum app settings on your Ledger device.

If so, try the following various tricks to try to get the ledger working in MetaMask.
1. Unplug the hardware wallet and then plug it in again.
2. Unplug the hardware wallet, close your browser, open your browser, plug the hardware wallet in.
3. Try a different USB cable.
4. Make sure you don't have any other apps open that are using the hardware wallet.
5. Try a different USB port.
6. Restart your computer.",,,,,

6.66E+17,bing2,2023-02-18T13:08:03.6890000-05:00,Unfortunately that depends on the token you're swapping. There are tokens that has internal buy/sell tax in them which is generally not supported in Uniswap but some can be traded by adjusting slippage tolerance.,,,,,

Here's what I'm trying to do: I'm making some smart contracts including ERC-20 tokens, and I was wondering whether to deploy it in ethereum mainnet, or polygon to make it cheaper when it comes to gas/fees.
I got an idea - why not deploy it on both and let people trade tokens 1:1 between the blockchains. I know uniswap can for example exchange ERC-20 matic on ethereum for matic on polygon, but what about custom tokens, would it be possible to use uniswap for swapping my custom tokens between ethereum and polygon?
I'd like to make liquidity pool of ethereum version of my tokens and polygon version, I just don't know if that's possible (at the moment tokens are not deployed yet).",,,,,

I see that I won't be able to do this on uniswap across two blockchains, my token has fees.
Just to clarify - I can't use uniswap across multiple blockchains, but withing one blockchain it will still be possible to make pool on uniswap V3, right? Or would I have to use only V2?
The token is supposed to keep constant supply, so when the supply goes above certain value fees start to deduce from transferred amount and get burned. It's one of it's basic functionalities, so I can't really remove the fees...",,,,,

Please can you help me. I am a beginner. I have problem with uniswap and BNB. I found on the internet arbitrage from binance to uniswap with BNB ETH. The profit would be very good, but now I have a problem again because the profit in uniswap is only in Etherium network. So I bought BNB at Binance and sent to uniswap BSC. Worked as well.
Then I added BNB in the Etherium network. But now I can't find any instructions how to transfer the amount from BNB in BSC network to BNB token in Etherium network. Otherwise, I won't have any profit. If you could show me a way, I would be very grateful. If this works, I am willing to pay you something. As I have heard, the American government now wants to regulate the crypto market strongly. It is clear that if every country makes their own digital currency true, then the crypto market will have to go. Hopefully it will take another year.

Please can you help me. I am a beginner. I have problem with uniswap and BNB. I found on the internet arbitrage from binance to uniswap with BNB ETH. The profit would be very good, but now I have a problem again because the profit in uniswap is only in Etherium network. So I bought BNB at Binance and sent to uniswap BSC. Worked as well.
Then I added BNB in the Etherium network. But now I can't find any instructions how to transfer the amount from BNB in BSC network to BNB token in Etherium network. Otherwise, I won't have any profit. If you could show me a way, I would be very grateful. If this works, I am willing to pay you something. As I have heard, the American government now wants to regulate the crypto market strongly. It is clear that if every country makes their own digital currency true, then the crypto market will have to go. Hopefully it will take another year. Thank you in advance and I wish you still a nice time. Greetings Frank.",,,,,

uniswapv2 fees are 0.3% per trade.

initial reserves of DAI/ETH pool is:
DAI: 10,000
ETH: 5
k: 50,000
ETH-DAI relative price: 0.0005

Person trades in 1 ETH for 1500 DAI.

new DAI reserves: 8500 DAI
new ETH reserves: 6 ETH
amt_0 IN = 0 dai
amt_1 IN = 1 eth
adjusted dai reserves = 8500 DAI
adjusted eth reserves = 6 - (1* 0.003) = 5.997 ETH
new_k = 50,974.5

this is correct cuz new_k > k and the eth balance now changes from 5 to 5.997 instead of 6. right?

And where does the 0.003 ETH in fees actually go to? back into the pool reserve balance or what, because I dont see it in the calculations.",,,,,

They both have 3 LP token and if they were to withdraw 3 LP token immediately after person B provided LP, they would get the same amount equally being

Person A 10 token X and 17 token Y
Person B 10 token X and 17 token Y

Person B while having the same no. of LP token doesn't necessarily mean he got shares from the previous fees while Person A gains from it from 1 token X to 9 token X and so is the other. These are exaggerated values though but should clarify things",,üëÜ (1),,,

7.27E+17,artofkot,2023-03-31T14:48:20.6430000-04:00,"Hi everyone,

I am an everyday LP on uniswap, and I just wanted to provide valuable feedback: the current LP UX on uniswap.org could be improved a lot. The primary problems are 
(1) not clear what the current liquidity is, when one picks out the range
(2) it is pretty hard to setup the range
Let me say that these problems are exacerbated ALOT when one operates on L2 (btw, L1‚Ä?L2 liquidity transition is underway)

There is like 20 more details to it, I would say that the UX of trader joe is much much better: if one wants a quick way to view what a good solution looks like.

I think the LP interface overhaul is long overdue, and I am afraid uniswap will start to lose its edge if it doesn't do it quickly

I didn't know where its appropriate to post. I am happy to go into details about possible interface improvements: the guideline should be to make it at least as good as trader joe's, by incorporating a lot of analytics into LP page and also simply doing stuff better",,,,,
