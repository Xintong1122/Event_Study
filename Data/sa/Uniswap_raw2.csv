9.89E+17,anthonynicholas.,2022-10-29T20:18:06.8950000-04:00,How is moonbeam different from other chains?,,,,,,,
8.22E+17,turrizt,2022-10-30T00:01:37.6570000-04:00,"Moonbeam is an EVM compatible parachain on Polkadot. Moonbeam is built using Rust and the Substrate framework, enabling rich tools for implementation, but also allowing for specialization and optimization. Moonbeam allows users to interact with:
EVM comptible / Polkadot / Dotsama + Cosmos ecosystem chains.

in general, the main goal of Moonbeam is to connect a ton of different chains and become an advanced place to build dapps, that is, developers will be able to build dApps, where, in turn, users will be able to interact with a large number of different assets in one place, that is, the main goal is to create the most convenient product for both developers and users.  

the Moonbeam team is currently working on a new milestone and is a pioneer in the field of so-called connected contracts. one of the use cases is a one-click swap, without having to look for bridges and so on. 

connected contracts refer to the cooperation of smart contracts on the ‚Äúbackend‚Ä?of the DApps users interact with on the blockchain. These contracts are connected across blockchains so there is no need to bridge assets in order to use assets in any application, on any connected chain. Moonbeam based connected contracts can use different messaging transports to send messages to other chains. XCM, Axelar, LayerZero, Hyperlane. once Chainlink CCIP is available i expect it will be available as a messaging transport as well.

Moonbeam founder Derek talked about all the advantages of Moonbeam in his speech at Polkadot Decoded:

I'm a bit new to uniswap amd had a few questions:

A few more questions:
1) If there are multiple pools that provide liquidity across a particular price band, how will the fees be distributed? Will it be proportional to the liquidity provided?
2) If there is a swap which cannot be executed by a single position (for example, due to the volume or due to the price band which is not covered by any position), how will such a swap be executed?",,,,,,,
7.46E+17,cindylo0,2022-10-31T03:23:06.2980000-04:00,"1. Not too sure about fees distribution but you can ask in #ü§ù‚îÇliquidity-providers. Yes, it will be proportional to the liquidity provided. 
2. As long as there is enough liquidity, the Uniswap auto router will find the best pool to route your swap.",,,,,,,

It states that 60% of the tokens (600M UNI) where destined towards the community.

I have a question.
I tried to set fee when user trade tokens (for example swap token A to B).
In that case, first user approve his A token to router then router call transferFrom function.
So I got this on transfer function on token  contract.
Then I reduce the fee from the transfer amount (token A) and send the remain amount to the pool
So the pool received Amount - fee.
But at the end of the trade, the pool send the original amount of token B (according to the original amount of A, not amount - fee).
I researched the uniswap contracts.
Uniswap doesn't calculate the return amount with the real received token amount.
It used the input amount on uniswap interface.(the uniswap interface used the swapExactTokensForTokens)",,,,,,,

You value eth at 1 usdc.

Because of this, if someone wants 1 eth, they put in 1 usdc, so you have 2 usdc and 0 eth.

This is an LP.

Think of ATTOM api services, they sell data for prices between 12,000 usd and 250,000 usd they are in the business of data collecting and selling but they won't sell their data to people who specifically market. But if you are collecting data, information, they are willing to fork over public information and curated data.

My name is Erden Karso and I currently work at Cyber Capital as a researcher. I am writing my master's thesis on whether incentive designs and voting mechanisms within DAOs or traditional/public companies are more efficient and effective at mitigating agency problems.

I am searching for active contributors within DAOs to interview. DAOs are a relatively new concept that needs more (academic) research and I will try my best to make sure that this research adds value to the crypto space and DAOs. The agency problem is a conflict of interest that occurs when agents (e.g. managers) don't fully represent the best interests of principals (e.g. shareholders/owners). In DAOs, the members are both the principal and the agent.

Are some of you interested to help make research literature less outdated? Interviews will be around 30min only. Please let me know.

Thank you for your time.",,,,,,,

2.79E+17,mushini,2022-12-01T14:40:07.9310000-05:00,"You mean the Genie.xyz collection?
There are no ""gems"" in that collection. I asked which NFT the ""Genie:Gem NFT"" refers to.

""This tier is also available to wallets that purchased a Genie:Genesis NFT or a Genie:Gem NFT between 5:59 pm and 9:15 pm UTC on June 21st.""
-- I assume Genie:Gem NFT refers to The Genie's Lamp from the Yat Gems collection.

The time range for eligibility corresponds _exactly_ to these tweets: <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539306971899351040> <https://twitter.com/Uniswap/status/1539356280212553728>

You can see that the price of the Genie's Lamp NFT (i.e. Genie:Gem NFT) was 0.1 ETH before the news and was likely pumped by misinformation and still selling for 0.3 ETH about a day later. The price did not *return* to pre-misinformation levels until sometime the next day (on OpenSea, specifically). Yet the eligibility requirements between and end strictly when the tweets were made (a 3 hour range). Some Genie:Gem NFT *holders* were also affected by this mishap as they chose to continue holding their Genie:Gem NFT (and chose not to sell into the news immediately). The same could possibly be said about the Genie:Genesis NFTs. [Misinformation included which NFTs were eligible (Genie:Genesis & Genie:Gem) and the snapshot date for holders.]

There are 76+2 Genie:Genesis NFTs. I assume all were included in the snapshot for April 15th.
And there are 69 Genie:Gem NFTs. At least a few were made eligible for the airdrop because they were ""bought"" during that 3 hour window on Jun 21st. It's a 5 million USDC airdrop; I estimate the airdrop fund would have increased by 1% if every holder had been made eligible. Why couldn't holders of this relatively small collection also have been made eligible (e.g. before the first tweet)? Or the buyers who bought the Genie:Gem NFT slightly after the 3 hour-window (a day later), paying an inflated price? It seems it also took the price of the Genie:Genesis NFT about a day to return to pre-misinformation levels -- not 3 hours. There is one sale of the Genesis collection on OpenSea 20-minutes outside of the eligibility window that I think was clearly inflated by misinformation (as the prices dropped a day later): <https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd1d7d54f709f1b1ec62f8459e1c8f706e745d55c8fb7a98c9c78da1ae0cbb978>

I do not think increasing the 5_000_000 budget by ~50_000 would have been unreasonable, and would have encompassed more parties affected by the misinformation mishap. (I just think a 1% increase is a relatively minor increase for this airdrop.)

I conclude misinformation is what pumped the prices of these NFTs for up to 24 hours, and that the 3-hour eligibility window was not adequately long.
Genie:Gem and Genie:Genesis aren't collection names nor are they the title of the NFTs (as far as I know). It would be helpful to refer to the specific NFTs or collections. __There is NO ""Gem"" NFT under the Genie.xyz collection__(0xc466e2F98f95CC4Cde31B134906f59E8264c1BE0)

In support of furthering the vision of Multichain Uniswap, proposing that the Uniswap community vote to authorize the deployment of Uniswap bridge. We hope this proposal will serve as an example to create a generalizable, trust-minimized approach to cross-chain deployments, with the goal of supporting a multichain Uniswap ecosystem.

As implied in the name, bridges allow one to easily migrate tokens from one chain to another. 

For example converting from Ethereum to Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Celo you will need to have some ETH in your Ethereum wallet to cover gas fees when converting. Similarly user should be able to migrate from the different chains supported by Uniswap

For this we would be creating separate tab in the home page of Uniswap.

Example use case
To switch between Ethereum and Arbitrum:
Click on the ""Bridge"" tab, and select ""Arbitrum Bridge"":

This will take you to the Arbitrum Token Bridge, where you can connect your wallet and ""deposit/withdraw"" tokens to and from the Arbitrum network.

Conclusion
Uniswap as community together we can serve as the foundation for the proliferation of natural capital assets across Web3. We believe that the vision to advance decentralization of financial services. Thank you for your consideration and we welcome questions and suggestions.",,,,,,,

I am doing calculations to see how much it should have generated in the last 24 hours and it turns out that I am generating less than it should.  I do a simple calculation dividing the total liquidity of the fees in the last 24 hours as shown by the Uniswap statistics. In this case I have $703.26 and I divide it by 3,760,000 TVL and it gives me 0.000187037234 I multiply it by 365 ( This is to get the daily profitability) 0.0682685904 (this is the annual profitability based on the calculation over the last 24 hours) to 365 to know the daily APR I put my investment and I multiply it by the annual APR which is $1000x0, 0682685904=$0.68 PER DAY (this is what should have been generated in the last 24 hours) but as you can see in the photos I have only generated 0.28 cents.  I hope I have been quite understanding and that someone can help me with this problem.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1051442374959706162/Screenshot_2022-12-11-10-56-49-428_com.kiwibrowser.browser.jpg?ex=65f6c305&is=65e44e05&hm=ff562a0354a5a8b88a7b33a94300bd9de1a0765fb74d82539bb480756032649d&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1051442375244914728/Screenshot_2022-12-11-10-59-41-073_com.miui.calculator.jpg?ex=65f6c305&is=65e44e05&hm=166182decb580aa8347fa448800ec3f395ae63c052398bb55bf30ed3fd34cd94&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1051442375454621737/Screenshot_2022-12-11-11-00-26-285_com.miui.calculator.jpg?ex=65f6c305&is=65e44e05&hm=6f44b1550c1dfc27d9cb4e6f8926af0a9a1ab9d6c9a1c93635a1da6458af9cd0&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1051442375697903616/Screenshot_2022-12-11-10-57-49-235_com.kiwibrowser.browser.jpg?ex=65f6c305&is=65e44e05&hm=5aabe48a08456eb1e065aef6cc77cf77f7e225057317122b06f5b2a3a68c2339&",,,,,,

7.77E+17,eternity_trance,2022-12-11T05:27:01.0440000-05:00,I appreciate your answer but my calculations are much more precise than the simulator since the simulators take into account different time ranges.  I think I have stated the problem quite clearly.  But I will try it in the help channel you mention.  Since I need a much more advanced answer to know what exactly is happening,,,,,,,
3.48E+17,kupeshnik,2022-12-11T05:42:01.7240000-05:00,Calculated fee is approximation based on past data. You may get the calculated fees when volume is higher than the average past volume.,,,,,,,
8.26E+17,undoubted08,2022-12-11T05:44:14.9010000-05:00,Calculating the fees for v3 is not the same for v2 since v3 is concentrated. You can check our whitepaper here: https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf,,,,,,,

It is what has been generated in the last 24 hours while I have liquidity in the pool.

3.48E+17,kupeshnik,2022-12-11T06:05:46.5680000-05:00,But you're still sort of averaging it by using 24 volume/fees and deriving APR. Can you first check whether you are getting fair share of the current generated fees by first calculating your liquidity ratio from TVL then multiply daily fees by that ratio?,,,,,,,

I really do not understand what part of that calculation is not clear.  These fees are simply distributed to the liquidity providers calculating the amount of their participation and their limiting range.  And nothing more is needed than dividing the total liquidity by the fees generated and then multiplying by 365 (THIS GIVES THE APR BASED ON THE LAST 24 HOURS WHICH IS ONLY VALID FOR THOSE LAST 24 HOURS)",,,,,,,

I have a question, perhaps for developers, that many tax professionals are struggling with. Who owns the Tokens in any given liquidity pool? Language  in v2 documents indicate that the LP token is a representation of the tokens owned my the holder. But other language indicating a transfer of ownership exists in v3 documents. I know the tokens are moved to the smart contract balance but, in the eyes of the developer, does that amount to a change of ownership? This answer can have significant tax impacts and perhaps a proposal to provide clarifications to the documentation would help ensure proper tax treatment.  Right now tax authorities can essentially argue both ways, whichever leads to more tax. Thanks",,,,,,,

I saw these two sentences in two separate CoinDesk articles: ""Uniswap, for instance, earns fees and pays returns to UNI token holders but doesn‚Äôt have revenues, Qureshi said."" https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/10/dragonflys-haseeb-qureshi-is-still-optimistic-in-the-crypto-bear-market/  ""could potentially mean lesser fee earnings for Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity providers and more rewards for holders of Uniswap‚Äôs native token UNI, which in turn accrues value for UNI holders.""  https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/11/first-mover-asia-uniswap-fee-switch-proposal-for-popular-ether-pools-stirs-up-community-debate/  Now, it's been a long time since there have been any farms for Uniswap.  But there were no farms back in 6/22 nor 11/22 when these articles were written, right?  Further that's still not the same thing as ""paying returns to UNI token holders"" or ""rewards for holders of Uniswap's native token UNI.""  That suggests just holding the token means you get some kind of profit share.  I mean, some fees get stored in some treasury, I believe, and having UNI can help you vote on how to spend that treasury, I believe, but that is not the same thing as saying if I have 2 UNI vs someone who has 1 UNI, I have twice as many ""rewards"" accrual power.  I mean 2 or 1 UNI is barely any power at all in governance, but the /only/ direct value I know of comes from selling it to others who, when combined in large amounts (millions of UNI, for example) can, say, accomplish something that might pull the funds from that treasury.

7.40E+17,Rey#5193,2022-12-28T04:52:25.7020000-05:00,"I see. Normally when we un stake or remove our liquidity. We just go to the Uniswap UI and then just select the pool pair that we want to remove liquidity. In your case yesterday, when you tried to remove your LP pair APEFI-ETH from the pool. It did not show up right? Sometimes this things happen. That is why we have workaround for this and that link we provided will automatically load your pool. I cannot explain the why in details but that is the logic behind it.",,,,,,,

7.46E+17,cindylo0,2022-12-28T04:55:38.8960000-05:00,"Also, when you added liquidity the first time, you received UNI-V2 LP tokens which represents your share of the pool. When you staked your LP tokens, it leaves your wallet and that is why you cannot find your pool while it was staked.",,,,,,,

Lets say I set my LP USDC/ETH from 900 to 1500 and I deposit there $1000. As price is reaching the 900, all my LP is converted to ETH, so, if the price drops under my range, in this case 900, I have there only ETH and I am loosing my value of $1000 due to price of ETH. 
And as price is reaching 1500, my LP is converted to USDC, so if the price goes over 1500, I have only my value I deposited in USDC, so still $1000?
Do I understand this correctly,  or can somebody explain this on this case for me?",,,,,,,

I just want to confirm that the ""tick"" field in this table is the ending tick of the trade. I went ahead and assumed this and used the previous swap's end_tick as the starting tick for the current swap and was able to determine the ticks that each swap went through. This is where I ran into some confusion, shouldn't all ETH for USDC swaps move the tick in the same direction (in this case: start tick >= end tick) and vice versa? I did not find this to be the case so does that mean something in my computations went wrong or this there a case where a ETH for USDC swap can result in a situation where the end tick > start tick?",,,,,,,

If you remove your liquidity the fees will also be included, not like in V3 where it is not autocompounded and you have to manually/separately claim it. You can also refer to the response below regarding the major difference between v2 and v3. You can also check the resources available in #üìå‚îÇfaq-troubleshooting about V3.

I'm all for censorship resistance, but if you can't transact both ways in a Uni-LP, seems awfully silly to not do something about that contract.
Can I issue a proposal to change this behaviour?",,,,,,,

Anyway, you can ask in #üíª‚îÇdev-chat if it's even possible for the contract to detect ALL ways how scam tokens are coded and if there is a solution, you can do a proposal in https://gov.uniswap.org/ with regards to its implementation

Alternatively, you can check#üê∂‚îÇscam-token-guide  for guidance before participating in activities related to those tokens. Additionally, if you do not wish to conduct your own research as stated when importing the custom tokens, it may be advisable to refrain from engaging with those tokens at all.",,,,,,,
3.18E+17,crablegs5818,2023-01-17T21:57:33.2780000-05:00,"Of course, I have culpability as well for not doing enough due diligence or testing swaps in both directions.  But, tbh, I would never have thought there would be a contract on Uni where I couldn't swap in or out.  My previous understanding of scam tokens is that they'll create an LP, find ways to manipulate a pump and then rug the stable coin side of the LP, leaving others with valueless tokens.  I didn't expect a contract on UNI that wouldn't be swappable in a given direction.",,,,,,,
4.27E+17,la1210,2023-01-17T21:58:59.2360000-05:00,You'll be surprised just how many tokens are like this are in the space üò¨ . You can stick with the listed assets for the meantime as you try to learn on how to spot these scams,,,,,,,
3.18E+17,crablegs5818,2023-01-17T22:00:06.0490000-05:00,"As for solutions to this, one simple one would be if a contract is found unswappable in both tokens, to at least delist it from the platform and ideally take over the pool.  I guess that introduces other vulnerabilities and ""governance"" but if the contract verifiably cannot swap in both directions, I cannot think of a case where an honest actor would be harmed if Uni were able to seize the contract.",,,,,,,
4.27E+17,la1210,2023-01-17T22:02:28.1670000-05:00,Not a dev but I really doubt if it would be simple to identify if a token is unswappable since there are mutliple ways to do it so. Feel free to have it discussed in #üíª‚îÇdev-chat for the possibility.

It says ""permit2"" under my permissions list on etherscan, but after I approved it the swap didn't work and said it couldn't estimate gas fees try again later. 

I got scared and revoked the permissions until I can figure out why this contract is popping up instead of the normal uniswap router contract. 

Can you please help?",,Uni (1),,,,,

bc you could still over time underperform if you hit the bounds too fast and too often so your LP has no time to cover the losses from the rebalancing
ie if you set the ranges like from 0.05 to 0.10 and yo start at 0.075 in my understanding you would either sell on average btc at 0.0875 or buy eth at 0.0625.

Ensure that Metamask is updated to version 10.5.2 or above.
Chrome users can manually force an update by going to Manage extensions > Developer mode > Update

Ensure that Ledger Live is closed otherwise it might prevent your Ledger device from connecting to Metamask.

Open the Ethereum (ETH) app on your Ledger device before clicking the ""Connect Hardware Wallet"" button in Metamask.

Ensure that your Ledger device runs the latest firmware version.
Ensure that your Ledger device is running the latest version of the Ethereum (ETH) app.
Ensure that blind signing is enabled in the Ethereum app settings on your Ledger device.

If so, try the following various tricks to try to get the ledger working in MetaMask.
1. Unplug the hardware wallet and then plug it in again.
2. Unplug the hardware wallet, close your browser, open your browser, plug the hardware wallet in.
3. Try a different USB cable.
4. Make sure you don't have any other apps open that are using the hardware wallet.
5. Try a different USB port.

Here's what I'm trying to do: I'm making some smart contracts including ERC-20 tokens, and I was wondering whether to deploy it in ethereum mainnet, or polygon to make it cheaper when it comes to gas/fees.
I got an idea - why not deploy it on both and let people trade tokens 1:1 between the blockchains. I know uniswap can for example exchange ERC-20 matic on ethereum for matic on polygon, but what about custom tokens, would it be possible to use uniswap for swapping my custom tokens between ethereum and polygon?
I'd like to make liquidity pool of ethereum version of my tokens and polygon version, I just don't know if that's possible (at the moment tokens are not deployed yet).",,,,,,,

I see that I won't be able to do this on uniswap across two blockchains, my token has fees.
Just to clarify - I can't use uniswap across multiple blockchains, but withing one blockchain it will still be possible to make pool on uniswap V3, right? Or would I have to use only V2?
The token is supposed to keep constant supply, so when the supply goes above certain value fees start to deduce from transferred amount and get burned. It's one of it's basic functionalities, so I can't really remove the fees...",,,,,,,

I believe you have some idea on how offchain part of Uniswap router v2 works.

Like for example, if I understand things correctly, now there is no 1% pool of LINK-USDC pair. If i create this pool and provide liquidity, will router automatically see it and take my liquidity into account when someone will be willing to swap LINK to USDC?",,,,,,,

I was just researching Uniswap and I have a question. 
In the future when/if v4 will be released, is it going to be deployed to all the chains that are currently supporting v3? 
Tried to research it to understand from the v2/v3 perspective, but I couldn't find any reliable resources.

Please can you help me. I am a beginner. I have problem with uniswap and BNB. I found on the internet arbitrage from binance to uniswap with BNB ETH. The profit would be very good, but now I have a problem again because the profit in uniswap is only in Etherium network. So I bought BNB at Binance and sent to uniswap BSC. Worked as well.
Then I added BNB in the Etherium network. But now I can't find any instructions how to transfer the amount from BNB in BSC network to BNB token in Etherium network. Otherwise, I won't have any profit. If you could show me a way, I would be very grateful. If this works, I am willing to pay you something. As I have heard, the American government now wants to regulate the crypto market strongly. It is clear that if every country makes their own digital currency true, then the crypto market will have to go. Hopefully it will take another year.

Please can you help me. I am a beginner. I have problem with uniswap and BNB. I found on the internet arbitrage from binance to uniswap with BNB ETH. The profit would be very good, but now I have a problem again because the profit in uniswap is only in Etherium network. So I bought BNB at Binance and sent to uniswap BSC. Worked as well.
Then I added BNB in the Etherium network. But now I can't find any instructions how to transfer the amount from BNB in BSC network to BNB token in Etherium network. Otherwise, I won't have any profit. If you could show me a way, I would be very grateful. If this works, I am willing to pay you something. As I have heard, the American government now wants to regulate the crypto market strongly. It is clear that if every country makes their own digital currency true, then the crypto market will have to go. Hopefully it will take another year. Thank you in advance and I wish you still a nice time. Greetings Frank.",,,,,,,

uniswapv2 fees are 0.3% per trade.

initial reserves of DAI/ETH pool is:
DAI: 10,000
ETH: 5
k: 50,000
ETH-DAI relative price: 0.0005

Person trades in 1 ETH for 1500 DAI.

new DAI reserves: 8500 DAI
new ETH reserves: 6 ETH
amt_0 IN = 0 dai
amt_1 IN = 1 eth
adjusted dai reserves = 8500 DAI
adjusted eth reserves = 6 - (1* 0.003) = 5.997 ETH
new_k = 50,974.5

this is correct cuz new_k > k and the eth balance now changes from 5 to 5.997 instead of 6. right?

And where does the 0.003 ETH in fees actually go to? back into the pool reserve balance or what, because I dont see it in the calculations.",,,,,,,

I am an everyday LP on uniswap, and I just wanted to provide valuable feedback: the current LP UX on uniswap.org could be improved a lot. The primary problems are 
(1) not clear what the current liquidity is, when one picks out the range
(2) it is pretty hard to setup the range
Let me say that these problems are exacerbated ALOT when one operates on L2 (btw, L1‚Ä?L2 liquidity transition is underway)

There is like 20 more details to it, I would say that the UX of trader joe is much much better: if one wants a quick way to view what a good solution looks like.

I think the LP interface overhaul is long overdue, and I am afraid uniswap will start to lose its edge if it doesn't do it quickly

I didn't know where its appropriate to post. I am happy to go into details about possible interface improvements: the guideline should be to make it at least as good as trader joe's, by incorporating a lot of analytics into LP page and also simply doing stuff better",,,,,,,

I want to use a contract to invoke the contract of Uniswap v3. This is my contract code:

    function swapExactInputSingle(uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {

        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(WETH9, msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);

        TransferHelper.safeApprove(WETH9, address(swapRouter), amountIn);

However, When I deployed and called the swapExactInputSingle method using Remix, an error `Fail with error STF` occurred.
The test network address is https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xb759a7e4bbd2f0a6c515994884df9d271592a0cae68b35138db93894e60b1aae.
Does anyone know what caused this error?

Why is in Uniswap v2 Pair contract the important functions such as ""mint"" and ""burn"" are external without any requirement or modifier who calls the function?

For example, if I call to mint with my address
the function performs some calculations with the contract variables and then mint new tokens to the given address.

It is possible to create new tokens for free?
There is any protection method?",,,,,,,

For example, which portion of funds should be deposited in 0.9996-1.0004 range, <0.9996 and >1.0004
For such task I need following data from the contract by blocks:
Change in USDC fees
Change in USDT fees
How much USDC and USDT liquidity was in each tick starting from 0.999 to 1.001 (it seems that there will be USDC and USDT liquidity in tick where currently swaps are performed and solely 1 token liquidity to the left from the current tick and to the right from the current tick, hence the tick where both tokens are present generates the return for LPs)

in the past, your approvals are mostly for max amounts of allowance to Uniswap (or other DEX), for example, approvals used to be 1000000 Token A. Unless you sold a total 1000000 Token A, you wont need to sign any more approvals until then.",,,,,,,

Dear Uniswap Support Team,

I recently added liquidity to the BRG/ETH pair on Uniswap, but now I am unable to see the deposited liquidity in the Remove Liquidity section. I've also noticed that the liquidity seems to have been transferred to the following address: 0xC34aE1A39662415a4720d4A3e7C2Be0E202568C2.

Here is the transaction ID for the liquidity deposit:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6d1015a61459057b07abf299840b33d22e28654a921cfa851f389c8e08838925

I've ensured that I'm connected to the correct wallet and network, but the issue persists. Could you please help me understand why my liquidity is not visible in the Remove Liquidity section and how I can resolve this issue?

I appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,",,,,,,,

tips to make sure your tx doesn't fail
use the average or high gas value when making a transaction
make sure your deadline is long enough to cover the time it takes the transaction to be picked up in a block (faster/more gas does speed this up to be accepted sooner)
Make sure your slippage value is enough to cover the changes in price that happen every block there is a trade. Prices jump a lot more during high volume times. You need to have the slippage for that volume to be large enough to cover the price change, but not to much more so as to not be front run",,,,,,,

I have an issue when develop uniswap flash loan.
When I borrow tokens using a flash loan, the tokens are transferred to the current contract address.
Is there any way for the flash loan to transfer tokens to other addresses(user wallet addresses) instead of the current contract address?
Or can all these steps happen in one transaction:
1. uniswap flash loan transfers tokens to the current contract(call it 0xcontract)
2. 0xcontract transfers tokens to the user address(call it 0xuser)
3. 0xuser pays back to the 0xcontract
4. 0xcontract pays back to the uniswap flash loan

It's seems when we transfer borrowed tokens from 0xcontract to 0xuser, 0xuser will receive the tokens, but we cannot make 0xuser transfer back the tokens in the same transaction",,,,,,,

I have a question about fees. Suppose that within a tick there are multiple positions, some of which are at fee tier 0.05% and some at 1%.
If a trade comes across at this tick, is it as simple as first utilising the liquidity at the 0.05% tier, then moving to the liquidity at the 1% tier?

Do we remain within that tick until all the liquidity across all fee tiers are exhausted?",,,,,,,

Why is it that on UniswapV3 swaps in different pools use a different amount of gas?
I thought that when using the swap router, every swap should use the same amount, but I noticed that some swaps use around 100k gas whereas others use up to 180k. 
I thought that the gas costs may depend on the number of ticks that the price moves through the swap, but the gas costs seem to be independent on the swap amount, just dependent on the respective pool.
Any ideas?",,,,,,,

I understand why IL is happening, but couldnt the be mechanisms to regulate it. 
For example some bridges incentivicing sending Liquidity more into own direction if its missing there and give
counterincentives if you want to take more of where its already low by fee structures, 
that couldnt potentially cause balancing arbitrage. 
Another maybe not so good one would be simply limiting how much a pool can get out of balance before the AMM accepts a trade that pushes 
the balance more in one direction than the other. 

Just wondering.",,,,,,,

9.89E+17,anthonynicholas.,2023-05-02T09:48:38.8630000-04:00,"Hey, this is a great question. When you use a token on a dapp, you need to approve that token first and in my cases, this is an unlimited approval meaning you don't need to reapprove the token on that dapp again. The problem with this is that dapps can be exploited and your funds can be taken from your wallet. One way to prevent this is to allow access to a certain amount of your tokens which is what custom spending cap does. For example, instead of me granting unlimited access to all of my ETH, I can tell a dapp that it only has access to only 0.5 ETH in my wallet.

```
gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

If you are hitting the `Max` button, Lot of times this button is off from the gas the wallet uses, so while it's amount is correct for the gas settings the UI uses, your wallet tends to add more gas to help make sure the transaction succeeds.

when clicking the max just reduce the amount of ETH your are buying with
keep in mind gas is extremely high right now at 102gwei

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

I would suggest looking into the following topics:
- Leveraged tokens
- Advanced concentrated liquidity positions
- Rebasing & atomic swapping of V3 positions automatically
- Staggering V3 positions

Also look at the Uniswap SDK. You can do a lot with the UI, but you can really do some wild stuff if you're building a dapp from scratch using Uniswap's SDK. You would likely want to build a custom logic for how your leveraged tokens are moved between your positions.
Also, you can utilize the Aave SDK as well to make your dapp more robust (for example use Gelato or another automation tool to collect fees periodically, lend/borrow, and add to your positions).

You can do a lot with the standard UX, but to really build something that lets you leverage with V3, you'll need to understand and use at least 3-5 SDKs and Libraries.

1inch - Many Chains, pretty much all EVM chains. Signature approval. My first choice as the entire limit order process is gasless, so no cost to you.
CowSwap - Ethereum, Gnosis. Transaction approval. Some tokens require gas for approval.
SushiSwap - Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche. Works the same as 1inch, uses the same contract as 1inch and CowSap
Dexalot - Avalanche
SpiritSwap - Fantom Opera
Matcha.xyz - Ethereum. Aggregator, allows for limit orders from many different DEXs
TraderJoe - Avalanche, Arbitrum. May not have limit order in place yet, but the dev branch of their code repo had it there last time I checked, so add that one to the ltl

You can do a pseudo limit order in Uniswap V3 by setting a range that is in the price you want to sell. The benefit being that you can accrue extra fees and set a wider range.

4.96E+17,jon.bray.eth,2023-05-05T12:28:08.0120000-04:00,"$PEPE is trending right now. It's up $1250% since April 28th. Currently trading for $3.8x10‚Åª‚Å∂ but there's some RSI divergence and momentum slowdown that looks like it's going to retrace between 38% ($2.4x10‚Åª‚Å∂) 61% ($1.5x10‚Åª‚Å∂) very soon.

I bought in at 5.2x10‚Åª‚Å∑ and sold at 3.8x10‚Åª‚Å∂ for a nice 631% profit, but I would caution against buying $PEPE right now unless the 1H candle closes above 4.5x10‚Åª‚Å∂ before the price corrects. The chart looks like momentum ran out.
I'm waiting for a pull-back to between the 30-60% retrace to buy more. If you're not that patient, I would at least let it pull back 8-10% in the event it flops.

Long term, I think PEPE will outperform every other memecoin. First off, it's a meme. Shib, Floki, they're not memes. PEPE has a place in internet history that is immortalized in this coin now.

Unless you're a huge believer in Shib and closely follow Shibanarium L2 development progress, I wouldn't waste my money there.

TBH, memecoins are the absolute last tokens I will ever buy. Too risky. For every 1000, 1 will make huge returns, but most will pump and use you for exit liquidity. Even Shib is being really sketchy about the release of their L2, and it's not clear what benefits ShibL2 brings to the table that the multitude of other EVMs don't.

IMO, Shib should have launched on Cosmos, they would have had a lot more utility there and could have brought billions into Cosmos Hub and some of the amazing projects on Cosmos that no-one knows about. Ethereum is oversaturated with memecoins.",,,,,,,

The single-asset pool is very high APR, the burn mechanic is uses to fund that. Also, burnt ARBDOGE can be converted into $AICODE, which can be staked to obtain more $ARB.

If you got ARB airdrop, at least claim it and sell it for $70 per account you got an ARB airdrop on.
Read the docs, I audited the contract, it's not malicious or dangerous, just a burn token with ARB buyback and some future goals of expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem. Seems legit for me.

This type of transaction is literally the crux of P2P contracts...
Everything I asked in my request can be done in a trustless manner since the advent of Uniswap V2.
1inch P2P orders also facilitate the LP tokens, which means no one has to trust that ""you send this then I send this"".
This is blockchain 101, these tools were made for exactly this purpose.
Why spend $60 in gas just to move assets that will eventually end up in someone else's LP that they have to spend $60 in gas to add when you can skip the middleman, find another AMPL/ETH provider and do a transaction for literally NO gas in a 100% trustless manner.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536201281586/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=11cab4d2dc2eac60fce0171342569e7ac7d733810378858927722b70a79792c6&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536473915402/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=399cdaedf510a800bd84d88cf17e2b5abbbdfca07d29c27669c0bac3e92bff22&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536679428218/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=caff2bbc1e3a28e259722425fed8a52658e6ab98ee2fbe6e2a3723a7ac688bfc&",,,,,,

4.96E+17,jon.bray.eth,2023-05-05T14:08:25.2770000-04:00,"Slippage is extremely simple to calculate. It's the constant Product formula for DEXs: `X * Y = k`

Ex:
X = ATOM in LP, price is $200
Y = USDC in LP, price is $1
Assume the initial breakdown of LP is 5 ATOM and 1000 USDC

X * Y = 5 * 1000 = 5000 = k, where k is the constant that can't be changed.

Alice buys 1 ATOM, liquidity of X drops to 4
To keep k constant:
Y = k / X = 5000 / 4 = 1250

So, to buy 1 ATOM, Alice contributes 1250 - 1000 = 250 USDC into the LP.
Even though the price of ATOM was $200, due to the relative size of the LP the slippage was 25%

You can simplify this mentally for estimation in that slippage is equal to the percentage of tokens in the LP that are being removed, added to the price to ensure k remains constant.

If the same pool is 10x bigger, slippage becomes 2.5%, 100x bigger, 0.25%

In an LP protocol without fee structures, slippage would be the only difference in price. Even though most pools are thousands if not millions of times larger than the example above, the fee structure sets a minimum percentage slippage (the tier).",,,,,,,

I provided the most ideal way to deal with a stuck transaction and you simply deleted my response. Why did you not reply to me with a reason as to why you think cancellations are the answer?

Not for nothing, but I've been an Ethereum developer since ETH launched. I know the gas costs of all the opcodes and how they abstract out to functions, and cancellations are a last resort.
Replacing a nonce with suitable gas and updating the Tx deadline will always result in a better outcome than a cancellation, 100% of the time. This is not a debate, this is how the EVM works.

I'm simply trying to be helpful as I've been doing this for a very long time. You're not doing anyone any favors by deleting the most acceptable answer for the easier one.",,,,,,,

4.71E+17,crypto_rachel,2023-05-06T23:37:32.4030000-04:00,"Gas fees are charged by the ether network for the work that the miners do in confirming the transaction. All txs that are accepted by the miners will have a fee even if it fails, or is canceled

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

5.52E+17,mortein3038,2023-05-10T17:44:38.0360000-04:00,What do you mean by trade curve? Some small difference is understood but for some pairs its too large,,,,,,,
6.78E+17,enzo.666,2023-05-10T17:44:56.4250000-04:00,"Sorry for reasking a newbie question, so, in low setting, if we take that as an example, the max fee it states is 41.39 USD, and let's say if gas fee goes beyond that, obviously it can't fullfill, so the question is, if it suddenly goes beyond that, would that 41.39 USD be deducted from my wallet even though the transcation won't be executed

And, is the low setting fine, or would you prefer to keep it on market",,,,,,,

5.52E+17,mortein3038,2023-05-10T17:46:21.1490000-04:00,"okay and what do you mean by current price, how is it different from quote price?",,,,,,,

```
Ticks are related directly to price. To convert from tick œÑœÑ, to price, take 1.0001œÑ1.0001œÑ 1.0001 to get the corresponding price. Let the tick-spacing be tsts and icic‚Ä?be the lower bound of the active tick-range, then the current tick-range is [ic,ic+ts)[ic‚Ä?ic‚Ä?ts) We can then map the current tick-range to the current price-range with

Everyone if you want you can co to https://www.alchemy.com/
They have Free accounts. You can get a free RPC through them and easy setup. If you change this RPC in your wallet you should have no issues with site.
Otherwise have patience infura is likely to be back up shortly

once you are in your dashboard click `Create App` https://imgur.com/hAauGv3

Have some coins on an exchange. (ERC20) currently.

Have a need to use crypto for some day to day commerce in a way that won't break the bank or ruin bottom lines with Tx fees, the ideal is to trade in a tether linked currency. 

What would be the best place to store my crypto in a way that is accessible and fluid with the fees of the day as those are everchanging?

wider ranges will limit work needed to maintain and less risk of IL

For Coinbase Wallet if you click receive in your wallet, you can then enter the token address in the search bar. (Highly suggested to use Address over Name as Scam tokens will steal and copy names)
If you have Trustwallet, follow this guide https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-add-a-custom-token/213

LPs can pursue single-sided liquidity allocation above the current spot price if they are provisioning the higher valued token or below the current spot price if they are provisioning the lesser valued token.

In the former case, the LP would effectively be selling out of their position as the asset that they provided increases in value. In the latter case, an LP would effectively be scaling into a position of the other asset as it continues to fall in price.

The uniswap wallet is an interface that operates your Secret Recovery Seed Phrase on the ethereum network.

On networks like ETH you need ETH in the wallet to pay for gas, but usually CEXs will send this to your wallet without chain fees (this depends on the CEX)
so you will need ETH in the wallet you transfer the USDT to so that you can use that USDT",,,,,,,

Like for example swapping 100 PEPE for 10 USDT in the V3 pool, and the pool had 1 000 PEPE and 100 USDT, what you are doing is adding 100 PEPE and removing 10 USDT from the pool, and the minimum price conversion from PEPE to USDT is that when you select a minimum price of 10 USDT and you deposit 1 PEPE, now the pool had 1 001 PEPE and 100 USDT, if the price of PEPE drops to 10 USDT, what happens is that 1 PEPE is converted into 10 USDT, now the pool has 1 000 PEPE and 110 USDT right?

Swaps happen all the time so prices constantly change. The minimum output is a percentage of loss your willing to take, this protects you from large changes in price (as long as set properly).. Only way you would pay .50 on a trade is if there was a 50% decrease in the price, which would also change the tokens in the pool before the swap",,,,,,,

In an automated market maker (AMM) like Uniswap V3, the price of an asset pair is determined by the ratio of the tokens in the liquidity pool. If there are no swaps or trades occurring for a specific asset pair, the price remains unchanged.

I am expressing concern that the actions taken by Uniswap right now (or inaction) is materially harming retail investors.  Regulatory agencies have public whistleblower programs and would take a lot of interest in a situation like this.  No one wants to go down that road but inaction right now and dragging your feet is going to continue to harm retail investors.  I really hope you read this carefully and press internally to have this resolved.,,,,,,,

4.71E+17,crypto_rachel,2023-05-29T23:13:57.2850000-04:00,"Uniswap UI uses it's own gas model, this differs from the one used in wallets. The max subtracts the gas amount from your balance.

This is an estimation, wallets over-estimate gas, so to make the transaction successful reduce the amount you are using by a small amount

```
gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

2. Number of users: At present, the casting users of sats are more than 10,000, and when all the casting is completed, it will be 500,000
Such a volume far exceeds ordi. In this circle, the number of users is always the foundation,
No exchange is going to turn away half a million adventurous customers.
3. Intrinsic value and meaning: Totally meaningless compared to the fact that ordi is just four random letters typed by the founders
Of. sats, as the smallest unit of btc, are of eternal value.
4. sats are the inheritance of the real btc value and the only meaning of brc20 for anyone again
Get on the btc bus.
5. Beware of sats' opponent, satk, which is anti-Sats",,,,,,,

We built Dialog (AskDialog .com) to help web3 projects like Sorare, NFTrade and NFTfi leverage on-chain data to better convert users.

As we're not on beta anymore, I'd love to get feedback from your growth team about Dialog to see if our tool could be relevant for the Uniswap DEX to increase your revenues and if you have already tested such a tool before.

I can provide a deck and/or a video demo if needed.

You can reach me by email gary@askdialog.com

in the top there is a drop down your ETH and USDC is on the Ethereum network. It can only be used on ethereum network now.

to use polygon you would need to use the bridge https://wallet.polygon.technology/polygon/bridge to move the USDC to polygon, and you would have to get Matic token for polygon gas atleast, as well as for LQ or there is a version of WETH on polygon, but it's not tied to the main currency like ETH",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1116873407456362506/image.png?ex=65f4db6a&is=65e2666a&hm=41c7e4ce1b27381ee2be017dc23f9399908db9827e4fbd86ec9635d5323aac41&,,,,,,
