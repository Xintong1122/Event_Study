I want to use a contract to invoke the contract of Uniswap v3. This is my contract code:

    constructor(ISwapRouter _swapRouter) {
        swapRouter = _swapRouter;
    }

    function swapExactInputSingle(uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {

        TransferHelper.safeTransferFrom(WETH9, msg.sender, address(this), amountIn);

        TransferHelper.safeApprove(WETH9, address(swapRouter), amountIn);

```
However, When I deployed and called the swapExactInputSingle method using Remix, an error `Fail with error STF` occurred.
The test network address is https://goerli.etherscan.io/tx/0xb759a7e4bbd2f0a6c515994884df9d271592a0cae68b35138db93894e60b1aae.
Does anyone know what caused this error?

Why is in Uniswap v2 Pair contract the important functions such as ""mint"" and ""burn"" are external without any requirement or modifier who calls the function?

For example, if I call to mint with my address
the function performs some calculations with the contract variables and then mint new tokens to the given address.

It is possible to create new tokens for free?
There is any protection method?",,,,,,,

For example, which portion of funds should be deposited in 0.9996-1.0004 range, <0.9996 and >1.0004
For such task I need following data from the contract by blocks:
Change in USDC fees
Change in USDT fees
How much USDC and USDT liquidity was in each tick starting from 0.999 to 1.001 (it seems that there will be USDC and USDT liquidity in tick where currently swaps are performed and solely 1 token liquidity to the left from the current tick and to the right from the current tick, hence the tick where both tokens are present generates the return for LPs)

Like I had to approve token A every time I wanted to sell it for token B and I had to approve token B every time I wanted to sell it for token A. All in one day. That was pretty expensive.

Today that amount is valued at $450k. The problem is that I made a huge error by set the gas limit on the transaction very low, so the transaction was pending for months on end. The transaction never went through and I've only now learned of the concept of bumping transactions. Is it possible to still bump this transaction so it goes through?

in the past, your approvals are mostly for max amounts of allowance to Uniswap (or other DEX), for example, approvals used to be 1000000 Token A. Unless you sold a total 1000000 Token A, you wont need to sign any more approvals until then.",,,,,,,

Dear Uniswap Support Team,

I recently added liquidity to the BRG/ETH pair on Uniswap, but now I am unable to see the deposited liquidity in the Remove Liquidity section. I've also noticed that the liquidity seems to have been transferred to the following address: 0xC34aE1A39662415a4720d4A3e7C2Be0E202568C2.

Here is the transaction ID for the liquidity deposit:
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x6d1015a61459057b07abf299840b33d22e28654a921cfa851f389c8e08838925

I've ensured that I'm connected to the correct wallet and network, but the issue persists. Could you please help me understand why my liquidity is not visible in the Remove Liquidity section and how I can resolve this issue?

I appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,",,,,,,,

tips to make sure your tx doesn't fail
use the average or high gas value when making a transaction
make sure your deadline is long enough to cover the time it takes the transaction to be picked up in a block (faster/more gas does speed this up to be accepted sooner)
Make sure your slippage value is enough to cover the changes in price that happen every block there is a trade. Prices jump a lot more during high volume times. You need to have the slippage for that volume to be large enough to cover the price change, but not to much more so as to not be front run",,,,,,,

I have an issue when develop uniswap flash loan.
When I borrow tokens using a flash loan, the tokens are transferred to the current contract address.
Is there any way for the flash loan to transfer tokens to other addresses(user wallet addresses) instead of the current contract address?
Or can all these steps happen in one transaction:
1. uniswap flash loan transfers tokens to the current contract(call it 0xcontract)
2. 0xcontract transfers tokens to the user address(call it 0xuser)
3. 0xuser pays back to the 0xcontract
4. 0xcontract pays back to the uniswap flash loan

It's seems when we transfer borrowed tokens from 0xcontract to 0xuser, 0xuser will receive the tokens, but we cannot make 0xuser transfer back the tokens in the same transaction",,,,,,,

I have a question about fees. Suppose that within a tick there are multiple positions, some of which are at fee tier 0.05% and some at 1%.
If a trade comes across at this tick, is it as simple as first utilising the liquidity at the 0.05% tier, then moving to the liquidity at the 1% tier?

Do we remain within that tick until all the liquidity across all fee tiers are exhausted?",,,,,,,

Why is it that on UniswapV3 swaps in different pools use a different amount of gas?
I thought that when using the swap router, every swap should use the same amount, but I noticed that some swaps use around 100k gas whereas others use up to 180k. 
I thought that the gas costs may depend on the number of ticks that the price moves through the swap, but the gas costs seem to be independent on the swap amount, just dependent on the respective pool.
Any ideas?",,,,,,,

I understand why IL is happening, but couldnt the be mechanisms to regulate it. 
For example some bridges incentivicing sending Liquidity more into own direction if its missing there and give
counterincentives if you want to take more of where its already low by fee structures, 
that couldnt potentially cause balancing arbitrage. 
Another maybe not so good one would be simply limiting how much a pool can get out of balance before the AMM accepts a trade that pushes 
the balance more in one direction than the other. 

Just wondering.",,,,,,,

9.89E+17,anthonynicholas.,2023-05-02T09:48:38.8630000-04:00,"Hey, this is a great question. When you use a token on a dapp, you need to approve that token first and in my cases, this is an unlimited approval meaning you don't need to reapprove the token on that dapp again. The problem with this is that dapps can be exploited and your funds can be taken from your wallet. One way to prevent this is to allow access to a certain amount of your tokens which is what custom spending cap does. For example, instead of me granting unlimited access to all of my ETH, I can tell a dapp that it only has access to only 0.5 ETH in my wallet.

```
gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

If you are hitting the `Max` button, Lot of times this button is off from the gas the wallet uses, so while it's amount is correct for the gas settings the UI uses, your wallet tends to add more gas to help make sure the transaction succeeds.

when clicking the max just reduce the amount of ETH your are buying with
keep in mind gas is extremely high right now at 102gwei

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

I would suggest looking into the following topics:
- Leveraged tokens
- Advanced concentrated liquidity positions
- Rebasing & atomic swapping of V3 positions automatically
- Staggering V3 positions

Also look at the Uniswap SDK. You can do a lot with the UI, but you can really do some wild stuff if you're building a dapp from scratch using Uniswap's SDK. You would likely want to build a custom logic for how your leveraged tokens are moved between your positions.
Also, you can utilize the Aave SDK as well to make your dapp more robust (for example use Gelato or another automation tool to collect fees periodically, lend/borrow, and add to your positions).

You can do a lot with the standard UX, but to really build something that lets you leverage with V3, you'll need to understand and use at least 3-5 SDKs and Libraries.

Let me know if you have any questions, I have some experience building non-traditional V3 strategies and leveraged tokens.",,,,,,,

1inch - Many Chains, pretty much all EVM chains. Signature approval. My first choice as the entire limit order process is gasless, so no cost to you.
CowSwap - Ethereum, Gnosis. Transaction approval. Some tokens require gas for approval.
SushiSwap - Ethereum, Polygon, Fantom, Avalanche. Works the same as 1inch, uses the same contract as 1inch and CowSap
Dexalot - Avalanche
SpiritSwap - Fantom Opera
Matcha.xyz - Ethereum. Aggregator, allows for limit orders from many different DEXs
TraderJoe - Avalanche, Arbitrum. May not have limit order in place yet, but the dev branch of their code repo had it there last time I checked, so add that one to the ltl

You can do a pseudo limit order in Uniswap V3 by setting a range that is in the price you want to sell. The benefit being that you can accrue extra fees and set a wider range.

Currently trading for $3.8x10â»â¶ but there's some RSI divergence and momentum slowdown that looks like it's going to retrace between 38% ($2.4x10â»â¶) 61% ($1.5x10â»â¶) very soon.

I bought in at 5.2x10â»â· and sold at 3.8x10â»â¶ for a nice 631% profit, but I would caution against buying $PEPE right now unless the 1H candle closes above 4.5x10â»â¶ before the price corrects. The chart looks like momentum ran out.
I'm waiting for a pull-back to between the 30-60% retrace to buy more. If you're not that patient, I would at least let it pull back 8-10% in the event it flops.

Long term, I think PEPE will outperform every other memecoin. First off, it's a meme. Shib, Floki, they're not memes. PEPE has a place in internet history that is immortalized in this coin now.

Unless you're a huge believer in Shib and closely follow Shibanarium L2 development progress, I wouldn't waste my money there.

TBH, memecoins are the absolute last tokens I will ever buy. Too risky. For every 1000, 1 will make huge returns, but most will pump and use you for exit liquidity. Even Shib is being really sketchy about the release of their L2, and it's not clear what benefits ShibL2 brings to the table that the multitude of other EVMs don't.

IMO, Shib should have launched on Cosmos, they would have had a lot more utility there and could have brought billions into Cosmos Hub and some of the amazing projects on Cosmos that no-one knows about. Ethereum is oversaturated with memecoins.",,,,,,,

The single-asset pool is very high APR, the burn mechanic is uses to fund that. Also, burnt ARBDOGE can be converted into $AICODE, which can be staked to obtain more $ARB.

If you got ARB airdrop, at least claim it and sell it for $70 per account you got an ARB airdrop on.
Read the docs, I audited the contract, it's not malicious or dangerous, just a burn token with ARB buyback and some future goals of expanding the Arbitrum ecosystem. Seems legit for me.

This type of transaction is literally the crux of P2P contracts...
Everything I asked in my request can be done in a trustless manner since the advent of Uniswap V2.
1inch P2P orders also facilitate the LP tokens, which means no one has to trust that ""you send this then I send this"".
This is blockchain 101, these tools were made for exactly this purpose.
Why spend $60 in gas just to move assets that will eventually end up in someone else's LP that they have to spend $60 in gas to add when you can skip the middleman, find another AMPL/ETH provider and do a transaction for literally NO gas in a 100% trustless manner.","https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536201281586/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=11cab4d2dc2eac60fce0171342569e7ac7d733810378858927722b70a79792c6&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536473915402/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=399cdaedf510a800bd84d88cf17e2b5abbbdfca07d29c27669c0bac3e92bff22&,https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/1104096536679428218/image.png?ex=65f48487&is=65e20f87&hm=caff2bbc1e3a28e259722425fed8a52658e6ab98ee2fbe6e2a3723a7ac688bfc&",,,,,,

4.96E+17,jon.bray.eth,2023-05-05T14:08:25.2770000-04:00,"Slippage is extremely simple to calculate. It's the constant Product formula for DEXs: `X * Y = k`

Ex:
X = ATOM in LP, price is $200
Y = USDC in LP, price is $1
Assume the initial breakdown of LP is 5 ATOM and 1000 USDC

X * Y = 5 * 1000 = 5000 = k, where k is the constant that can't be changed.

Alice buys 1 ATOM, liquidity of X drops to 4
To keep k constant:
Y = k / X = 5000 / 4 = 1250

So, to buy 1 ATOM, Alice contributes 1250 - 1000 = 250 USDC into the LP.
Even though the price of ATOM was $200, due to the relative size of the LP the slippage was 25%

You can simplify this mentally for estimation in that slippage is equal to the percentage of tokens in the LP that are being removed, added to the price to ensure k remains constant.

If the same pool is 10x bigger, slippage becomes 2.5%, 100x bigger, 0.25%

In an LP protocol without fee structures, slippage would be the only difference in price. Even though most pools are thousands if not millions of times larger than the example above, the fee structure sets a minimum percentage slippage (the tier).",,,,,,,

I provided the most ideal way to deal with a stuck transaction and you simply deleted my response. Why did you not reply to me with a reason as to why you think cancellations are the answer?

Not for nothing, but I've been an Ethereum developer since ETH launched. I know the gas costs of all the opcodes and how they abstract out to functions, and cancellations are a last resort.
Replacing a nonce with suitable gas and updating the Tx deadline will always result in a better outcome than a cancellation, 100% of the time. This is not a debate, this is how the EVM works.

I'm simply trying to be helpful as I've been doing this for a very long time. You're not doing anyone any favors by deleting the most acceptable answer for the easier one.",,,,,,,

4.71E+17,crypto_rachel,2023-05-06T23:37:32.4030000-04:00,"Gas fees are charged by the ether network for the work that the miners do in confirming the transaction. All txs that are accepted by the miners will have a fee even if it fails, or is canceled

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

```
Ticks are related directly to price. To convert from tick Ï„Ï„, to price, take 1.0001Ï„1.0001Ï„ 1.0001 to get the corresponding price. Let the tick-spacing be tsts and icicâ€?be the lower bound of the active tick-range, then the current tick-range is [ic,ic+ts)[icâ€?icâ€?ts) We can then map the current tick-range to the current price-range with
[1.0001ic,1.0001ic+ts)[1.0001icâ€?1.0001icâ€?ts)

Everyone if you want you can co to https://www.alchemy.com/
They have Free accounts. You can get a free RPC through them and easy setup. If you change this RPC in your wallet you should have no issues with site.
Otherwise have patience infura is likely to be back up shortly

once you are in your dashboard click `Create App` https://imgur.com/hAauGv3
once it's created click `view key` and copy the HTTPS link, You can replace or create a new network in your wallet. Use that link (also don't share RPC key)

yes, when adding LQ the K value will increase, however it doesn't change the math so much as its changing x & y also so the change is equal and wont change the price.

the lower and upper limits are choices based on your risk analysis tighter ranges higher fee returns but higher risk of IL
wider ranges will limit work needed to maintain and less risk of IL

If your position goes out of range it will become 100% of one of the two tokens, and will stop earning fees until it is back in range",,,,,,,

For Coinbase Wallet if you click receive in your wallet, you can then enter the token address in the search bar. (Highly suggested to use Address over Name as Scam tokens will steal and copy names)
If you have Trustwallet, follow this guide https://community.trustwallet.com/t/how-to-add-a-custom-token/213

LPs can pursue single-sided liquidity allocation above the current spot price if they are provisioning the higher valued token or below the current spot price if they are provisioning the lesser valued token.

In the former case, the LP would effectively be selling out of their position as the asset that they provided increases in value. In the latter case, an LP would effectively be scaling into a position of the other asset as it continues to fall in price.

4.71E+17,crypto_rachel,2023-05-22T14:52:16.5330000-04:00,"for starters unless you are speaking of the uniswap wallet, you would be sending to an address you control, uniswap doesn't handle funds only swaps. The uniswap wallet is an interface that operates your Secret Recovery Seed Phrase on the ethereum network.

On networks like ETH you need ETH in the wallet to pay for gas, but usually CEXs will send this to your wallet without chain fees (this depends on the CEX)
so you will need ETH in the wallet you transfer the USDT to so that you can use that USDT",,,,,,,

Like for example swapping 100 PEPE for 10 USDT in the V3 pool, and the pool had 1 000 PEPE and 100 USDT, what you are doing is adding 100 PEPE and removing 10 USDT from the pool, and the minimum price conversion from PEPE to USDT is that when you select a minimum price of 10 USDT and you deposit 1 PEPE, now the pool had 1 001 PEPE and 100 USDT, if the price of PEPE drops to 10 USDT, what happens is that 1 PEPE is converted into 10 USDT, now the pool has 1 000 PEPE and 110 USDT right?

If you add 10 PEPE to the PEPE/USDT V3 pool, and select a minimum price of 0.50 USDT, if the price drops to that value, your 10 PEPE will be converted into 5 USDT, and if the pool had 1 010 PEPE and 100 USDT (technically 1 000 PEPE and 100 USDT since it's out of range), now it should be 1 000 PEPE and 105 USDT right?",,,,,,,

Swaps happen all the time so prices constantly change. The minimum output is a percentage of loss your willing to take, this protects you from large changes in price (as long as set properly).. Only way you would pay .50 on a trade is if there was a 50% decrease in the price, which would also change the tokens in the pool before the swap",,,,,,,

If there are no swaps or trades occurring for a specific asset pair, the price remains unchanged.

8.03E+17,begsy12,2023-05-26T13:28:25.0270000-04:00,@Anthony I want you to confirm that you have read this.  I am expressing concern that the actions taken by Uniswap right now (or inaction) is materially harming retail investors.  Regulatory agencies have public whistleblower programs and would take a lot of interest in a situation like this.  No one wants to go down that road but inaction right now and dragging your feet is going to continue to harm retail investors.  I really hope you read this carefully and press internally to have this resolved.,,,,,,,

This is an estimation, wallets over-estimate gas, so to make the transaction successful reduce the amount you are using by a small amount

```
gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org

Compare ordi with sats
1. Fairness :ordi's chips are too concentrated. Early participants have a lot of chips and sell at the high point.
Ferrari. Money's out of the loop. The market's down. The number of sats is enormous, possibly as long as several
The mint time of the month gives more opportunities to all those who care about sats, rather than a few capitalists and secs
The preserve of scientists.
2. Number of users: At present, the casting users of sats are more than 10,000, and when all the casting is completed, it will be 500,000
Such a volume far exceeds ordi. In this circle, the number of users is always the foundation,
No exchange is going to turn away half a million adventurous customers.
3. Intrinsic value and meaning: Totally meaningless compared to the fact that ordi is just four random letters typed by the founders
Of. sats, as the smallest unit of btc, are of eternal value.
4. sats are the inheritance of the real btc value and the only meaning of brc20 for anyone again
Get on the btc bus.

We built Dialog (AskDialog .com) to help web3 projects like Sorare, NFTrade and NFTfi leverage on-chain data to better convert users.

As we're not on beta anymore, I'd love to get feedback from your growth team about Dialog to see if our tool could be relevant for the Uniswap DEX to increase your revenues and if you have already tested such a tool before.

I can provide a deck and/or a video demo if needed.

You can reach me by email gary@askdialog.com
