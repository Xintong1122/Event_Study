As a dual resident, I have rights to how I do things in Guatemala. I've talked to a few Binance reps via chat and they say they are unable to help, telling me to ""not waste their time."" They wouldn't let me talk to a supervisor and don't do emails. Yet, being a part of the Flare airdrop, it will be done over 2 years and I'll lose out on thousands of dollars worth.

I have question about Binance Bridge.

When I‚Äôm trying to use Binance Bridge to move my funds from Erc20 to Bep20
I don‚Äôt have option to swep some BNB gas in order, which option is available on all tutorials which I watched.

This feature doesn't supported any more?
Or is suspended for some reason in last days?

Someone can tell if this option will be available again or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
I need get some BNB on my Bep20 wallet to to pay fee for transaction on this network.

Binance Bridge has any support to ask them about that?

However you may need to fill a report to your local police, the chance is very low to recover the funds, i know there are units who can chase the funds, with a small chance someone will convert a part to fiat money so at this moment they can be busted. You also need to investigate why the hack happened because if it happened once it will happen again if you do not sanitize your situation. Good luck this is going to be a long way and a long fight.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

‚û°Ô∏è If you are in need of assistance, you can reach out to our Live Chat Support Team by Tapping üëâ Here! (https://www.binance.com/en/chat)
If you are still confused regarding how to contact Support, See this How-To üëâ Video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VelozCwX28&t=5s)

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban
- Animated emoji spammer will be muted/kicked/banned (As the case may be)
- Massive shilling (rockets, moon) and senseless dropping of coin names will be punished also.
- No PM, DM, message me

3Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be one is a SCAM

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share personal info, the only info anyone is likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And there is no Binance support on Discord/Telegram!

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,,,,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

6.16E+17,bafaelgr8241,2021-11-19T12:23:06.5070000-05:00,"iv.  An account satisfies ¬ß 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D) if its primary function is to provide general transaction capability, even if an individual consumer does not in fact use it to conduct multiple transactions. For example, the fact that a consumer may choose to withdraw the entire account balance at an automated teller machine or transfer it to another account held by the consumer does not change the fact that the account's primary function is to provide general transaction capability.

v.  An account whose primary function is other than to conduct transactions with multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, or at automated teller machines, or to conduct person-to-person transfers, does not satisfy ¬ß 1005.2(b)(3)(i)(D). Such accounts may include, for example, a product whose only function is to make a one-time transfer of funds into a separate prepaid account.

9.  Redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants. For guidance, see comments 20(a)(3)--1 and --2.

10.  Person-to-person transfers. A prepaid account whose primary function is to conduct person-to-person transfers is an account that allows a consumer to send funds by electronic fund transfer to another consumer or business. An account may qualify as a prepaid account if its primary function is person-to-person transfers even if it is neither redeemable upon presentation at multiple, unaffiliated merchants for goods or services, nor usable at automated teller machines. A transaction involving a store gift card would not be a person-to-person transfer if it could only be used to make payments to the merchant or affiliated group of merchants on whose behalf the card was issued.",,,,,,

8.62E+17,aqibsahib,2021-11-19T13:34:46.2320000-05:00,"Binance Group for the community. No financial advice.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,,,,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,,,,,

8.62E+17,aqibsahib,2021-11-19T18:24:49.8480000-05:00,"Binance Group for the community. No financial advice.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,,,,,

‚ù?There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

Reminder:

The Binance Discord Server is a platform for discussion.
- Advertising coins or projects unaffiliated with Binance CEX result in a kick/ban.
- Offensive imagery/language > Ban

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,üëç (1),,,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server",,,,,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat

‚ù?There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat

‚ù?There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application

What are the benefits?
‚ú?Secure payments

The deadlines are 24/48h working hours to fund the account in SEPA.
2Ô∏è‚É£Go to Binance then, Wallet -> Deposit -> Fiat -> Advcash -> select the desired amount -> Confirm
3Ô∏è‚É£You will be redirected to the advcash site where you will need to confirm the deposit (you may be asked to verify via email).
4Ô∏è‚É£Your deposit is now available from your spot portfolio on Binance

1Ô∏è‚É£Go to Binance then, Wallet -> Withdrawal -> Fiat -> Advcash -> select the amount you want -> Confirm

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat 
www.binance.com/en/chat",,,,,,
8.85E+17,MEE6,2021-11-22T11:00:26.5340000-05:00,"‚ùóÔ∏è Important Reminder ‚ùóÔ∏è

‚ù?There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏

The largest cryptocurrency has given up some of its gains, and it‚Äôs currently flatlining at $57,361.

On Nov. 26, the crypto king plunged more than 9% amid concerns that the pandemic may worsen due to the new Omicron variant.

On Sunday, however, Bitcoin soared over 7%, putting the bulls back in the driver‚Äôs seat and invalidating bearish scenarios.

The bellwether crypto would need to gain another 6% in order to avoid printing a red monthly candle this December.

Bitcoin is also -17.03% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $69,044 that was reached on Nov. 10.

9.13E+17,mobfigure_,2021-12-10T19:15:51.7660000-05:00,"a person with $10,000 on 5x leverage can play as if he actually has $50,000 and his capital acts as collateral.

so lets say he short sells 100 LUNA.

entry price: $60
exit:$54
quantity: 100 luna

if luna goes to 66 thats a 10% increase so we are taking a, $3000 loss.

10% => $3000
33.3333% => $10,000

so if luna increases by 33.33% we get liquidated.

on a 10% decrease we make:
$3000.

I am still a fan of Binance.com but the platform just can't be trusted for airdrop distributions.,,,,,,

In my life, I have three mail goal
To Career, To Family, and To investment
2021 as the first year in life I started investment, I lost 70% of my 7 years saving by Spot only, I shall not blame anyone of being Fomo and Fud and learned from my past
In recent months I‚Äôve set my final investment goal, to reach 500 BNB in my life and benefit from Launchpad, by buying BNB every Friday night per 5% of my month salary and HODL
I know it‚Äôs just a unremarkable dream, but I‚Äôm just a normal person who believe in BNB, at that moment I can be more persuasive and proudly introduce my friends and family into Binance community. At that moment, I‚Äôll be reaching accomplishment among all three goals, to have all of them in a balance way, Merry Christmas all and my the force be with BNB! I wish to have 10 BNB so I can speed up my progress

They then followed him because of the trust they have in him. Getting to the mountain, he started climbing whole the rest waited at the base waiting for the ""eureka"" sound or anything of hope. He keeps climbing checking here and there not fully sure what is what, but was willing to learn on the process and ask from other climbers he found on his way up to the mountain. 

However, its been a while since he went up and has not been able to show his people down there any evidence that the gold could be fould rather kept asking for more supplies.

This ""MyCryptoWish Challenge"" will serve like the first thing I can get to show to calm myself and most importantly the people at the base of the mountain that the mountain indeed does contain gold and if only they can still continue their support what was promised is true and perhaps they can join in the search for the gold as well.

Winning this will serve as a fuel for me and assurance for many who waits on me. It will be the first fruit to be shared and an evidence of growth into the new year.

Dear Binance,
We are the wind orchestra ""G.Rossini"" (Italy, Latina), born in 1952 and, for us, 2020 and 2021 have been very difficult. In addition to the Covid emergency that we are experiencing and has prevented us from making concerts, there has been the lack of a venue where we can rehearse, due to security issues, but, despite this, we have not lost heart. 
Our desire would be to organize concerts throughout the year both in our city and in the rest of the world, as we did before.
We are a group of 60 people, there are professionals, conservatory students and many young people who love music.

We have won several international competitions:

""21st International Festival Of Wind Orchetras Prague"":
first prize with the score of 90,3/100 in the middle class category and the special prize for the best performance of the compulsory piece.

""XXI National Competition for Band La Bacchetta d'oro"":
First prize with a score of 90,68/100 in the second category

XVIII Band Competition Riva Del Garda:
third place with a score of 90.13/100 competing for the first category.

XVII Riva Del Garda Band Competition:
first place with a score of 91,42/100 second category

XII Band Competition city of Scandicci:
first place

For this reason we are writing this letter to you, hoping that it will be accepted, in order to make our wish come true. It would also be great to collaborate with Binance, and we could compose (we have very good composers known in the world in our group) and record music for Binance!

I'll end this letter with some photos and a comment from the famous composer David Holsinger:

""WOW! This band is incredible. What a marvelous performance! I am very impressed with the flair of this group and their illustrious conductor! Well done!""
