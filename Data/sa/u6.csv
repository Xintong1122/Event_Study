If you want to correct the spot price, the spot price changes only during swapping. You need to do a swap to correct the price and then add liquidity.

is that if a fork occurs, the two networks will split off into different universes - both sides will respect their (shared) history BEFORE the split but will not care at all about what happens on the other chain after the split. So if you have tokens before the fork, you will have two sets of tokens - one on each chain. and what you do with those tokens will not affect the other set of tokens. There will not be any ongoing mirroring of actions after the fork. 

As a practical matter I do not think that a PoW fork will exist for very long and I do not think the value of tokens on that chain will be relevant.",,ğŸ‘† (2),,,

Uniswap has something kinda like a range order, but not usually the way users would want to
this is done with a very small range Lq position that would convert to the opposite token at a certain price
but take example of eth / usdc
placing a small range order as price raising from x eth per usdc you will end up with USDC not Weth as price is rising and opposite as price falls

UNI Allocation

1 billion UNI have been minted at genesis and will become accessible over the course of 4 years. The initial four year allocation is as follows:

60.00% to Uniswap community members 600,000,000 UNI

21.266% to team members and future employees with 4-year vesting 212,660,000 UNI

18.044% to investors with 4-year vesting 180,440,000 UNI

0.69% to advisors with 4-year vesting 6,900,000 UNI

A perpetual inflation rate of 2% per year will start after 4 years, ensuring continued participation and contribution to Uniswap at the expense of passive UNI holders.

A Retrospective

Uniswap owes its success to the thousands of community members that have joined its journey over the past two years. These early community members will naturally serve as responsible stewards of Uniswap.

15% of UNI 150,000,000 UNI can immediately be claimed by historical liquidity providers, users, and SOCKS redeemers/holders based on a snapshot ending September 1, 2020, at 12:00 am UTC.

4.91664% pro-rata to all 49,192 historical LPs 49,166,400 UNI

~49 million UNI are claimable by historical liquidity providers. The formula accounts for LP liquidity on a per-second basis since the deployment of Uniswap v1, ensuring that rewards are weighted towards LPs that provided liquidity when total liquidity was low.

10.06136% split evenly across all 251,534 historical user addresses 100,613,600 UNI

400 UNI are claimable by each address that has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. This includes ~12,000 addresses that have only ever submitted failed transactions â€?love you guys.

0.022% to 220 SOCKS holders/redeemers 220,000 UNI

1000 UNI are claimable by each address that has either redeemed SOCKS tokens for physical socks or owned at least one SOCKS token at the snapshot date.```",,,,,

1. If the price of either goes 'out of range' nothing happens except that I will no longer receive swap fees.  At that point if I removed my LP position while out of range I would have 100% of the tokens in the one that lost or gained the most value depending on which direction it went?
2. If the price re-entered the range, it would then automatically begin collecting fees again?
3. If I removed my LP position while out of range what is the value of the LP?  For example if I start an LP with Token1 and Token2 of $100 each and Token2 goes up to $200 and Token1 stays at $100 and this puts the tokens OUT OF RANGE and I choose to withdraw the LP, I would have $300 (less impermanent loss) of Token1 (the less valuable token)?",,,,,

Is current price representative of the fill price of the last executed trade which may have crossed between ticks, does each tick actually cover a range of prices?

Basically, the idea is that lots of great content get created by the community but become hard to find. So, the site helps projects curate content as a community all in one place as it isnt dependent on one person to do everything. At the same time, it should make it easier for newcomers to learn more. 

So, each project can set their own admins/mods and control what gets posted on their page. I already added some content to the uni page but definitely missing a lot of stuff. Would love to hear if you've got any feedback or questions. Ideally the community would love the site, start adding content and take over ownership of the page from me. 

There's also a discord bot that integrates with the Q&A section, so hopefully less time can get spent on routine support. Example gif is for curve but would work the same with any questions added to the uniswap page.",,Uni (2),,,
