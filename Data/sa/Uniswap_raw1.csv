If i go to advanced I can set various parameters..

 the gas limit (currently set to 48000 by MetaMask)
max priority fee (set to 1.41 GWei by MM)
and max fee (set to 70.74 GWei by MM)

What are these values? and can i adjust them?

Then if I check gas fees on gasnow website I see that the current standard fee is 56 Gwei and transaction cost only around 4-5 $ for ether and between 20-30$ on uniswap..

Can i adjust the metamask gas fee to 56. and how?

I've been playing with the etherscan pages related to the token for a while but this is where my understanding of this world falters tbh. There are 2 pages on etherscan: the /address/0x... on which you land from the link on uniswap, and the /token/0x... that you showed me how to get to in your latest message. 
- I'm scratching my head trying to make sense between the ""Transactions"", ""Internal Txns"" and ""Erc20 Txns"" tables on the /address/0x...
- On the /token/0.xxx page I've exported into csv the ""Transfers"" table, I can see ""Add liquidity in ETH"" in the Method column. Is this what I'm looking for? 
I imagine I need to take into account when liquidity is removed and measure the difference by date. What about all the swaps in the ""Erc20 Txns"" page. Someone swapping ETH for a token is adding liquidity too, aren't they?",,,,,,

We think another (rough) way to figure out how much ETH was in the pool at all time is to take the total liquidity, divide it by 2, then normalised by price of ETH. So I tried to source this dataset, which I can see on uniswap's page for the pool/pair in graph form! Obviously the data is there, I just can't figure out how to export it. A friend of a friend working as a dev at ethereum I believe told us to use thegraph, which is precisely what uniswap is using and what I'm looking at on the page pool's page. 
So my question is this: is it possible to export in table format the ""liquidity"" graph? 
I couldn't find anything on etherscan side. I can see what I need in graph form on uniswap, just need to find a way to export it.",,,,,,

Select one price range and run the backtest, the gross fee apr will in the result. 3„ÄÅThere is no any necessary to stop loss in the v3. For example, if your have a position with price range [2000, 4000] , you want have a stop loss in 2500 and 3500. you only need to set your price range in [2500, 3500] with less token but have the same liqudity as the [2000. 4000] position.",,üëç (1),,,,

The reason I ask is because I have two addresses that made transactions before September 2020 that I didn‚Äôt claim the airdrop for. But on the Dapp it says there‚Äôs nothing to claim.

4.56E+17,Deleted User,2021-10-16T19:20:08.9280000-04:00,"Hi, I'm fairly new to crypto and have been trading using Coinbase. I recently decided to venture outside of Coinbase to invest in other crypto using Uniswap. I created a Coinbase wallet and have been hit with multiple fees in order to get funds from Coinbase into my wallet (Coinbase fee and miner/gas fees). I initially put USDC into the wallet not realizing that I needed ETH. I got charged a $23 network fee jut to have USDC approved for trading. I've also paid multiple fees getting Etherium into my wallet. When I go to swap USDC for other coins, i complete the confirmations, agree to the fees and hit the swap buttom but nothing ever processes. My first question is if it's normal to pay huge fees when using a wallet and Uniswap and if so how does anyone afford to do so. I considered transferring the funds back to my Coinbase but I'm going to get hit with huge fees for that as well. This process almost seems like a scam. I don't understand why I keep paying these big fees to move things between my Coinbase account and my Coinbase wallet. and then even more fees when using Uniswap (which I can't get to work as it keeps telling me to deposit more Eherium). I tried doing a trade within my wallet and it is telling me I need to deposit more Etherium because $123 is not enought. It's asking for another $100+ dollars of Etherium. So does it cost hundreds of dollars in fees of Etherium just to get into say SpaceDoge?",,,,,,
6.66E+17,bing2,2021-10-16T19:23:16.1720000-04:00,All transactions in Ethereum requires ETH for transaction fees a.k.a gas fees. Gas fees don't depend on how big your swap is. It depends on the network activity (volume of transactions in Ethereum) and the complexity of the transaction.,,,,,,
4.56E+17,Deleted User,2021-10-16T19:26:59.9900000-04:00,Am I correct that you have to have a wallet to trade on Uniswap and that you are going to have to pay network fees anytime you are moving crypto into the wallet and anytime you move it out? Any idea why it's wanting me to have hundreds of dollars in Eth to do a USDC to SpaceDoge swap? Will I actually be charged hundreds of dollars for that transaction if I did it now? Is there a better time to do swaps to pay less fees because I keep getting a message saying network fees are high,,,,,,
6.66E+17,bing2,2021-10-16T19:29:38.3770000-04:00,"Yes, you need to have a non-custodial wallet (which means you manage your own keys). Miners will always include the transactions with the highest gas price first, so users usually set a high gas price for faster transactions. You can find current gas prices here: https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator",,,,,,
6.66E+17,bing2,2021-10-16T19:30:57.0390000-04:00,"And yes, you can wait until fees are lower. You can find historical gas prices in https://ethereumprice.org/gas/ and see what time the gas fees are usually lower.",,,,,,

Then do your swap and in metamask change the gas limits to be at what you are comfortable with.
Note that **dangerous** it's very likely that 2 thing will happen.
- Either the token you buy is getting too pricy, then your TX will just fail costing gas and doing nothing.
- Or the token you buy is getting less pricy, then your TX will get front runned by a bot, he will make you pay the price at the time you emited the TX but executing at market rate, pocketing the difference.

4.71E+17,crypto_rachel,2021-10-21T01:22:44.5670000-04:00,"```Uniswap v3 introduces:

Concentrated liquidity, giving individual LPs granular control over what price ranges their capital is allocated to. Individual positions are aggregated together into a single pool, forming one combined curve for users to trade against

Multiple fee tiers , allowing LPs to be appropriately compensated for taking on varying degrees of risk

These features make Uniswap v3 the most flexible and efficient AMM ever designed:

LPs can provide liquidity with up to 4000x capital efficiency relative to Uniswap v2, earning higher returns on their capital

Capital efficiency paves the way for low-slippage trade execution that can surpass both centralized exchanges and stablecoin-focused AMMs

LPs can significantly increase their exposure to preferred assets and reduce their downside risk

LPs can sell one asset for another by adding liquidity to a price range entirely above or below the market price, approximating a fee-earning limit order that executes along a smooth curve```

7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-10-23T05:58:37.0620000-04:00,Uniswap has a default transaction deadline of 20 mins for V2 and 30 mins for V3. You need to make sure your transaction is confirmed within that time limit or your transaction will fail. The only way is to wait for when gas fees are low/cheaper. You can monitor the gas price here: https://www.blocknative.com/gas-estimator,,,,,,

I am sending this message because it seems that I am having an issue with my wallet. Today, I bought about $200 worth of HOKK on Uniswap. At first, I thought everything went through - no issue- however, a few hours later when I went to check my wallet, I noticed that I only have about 350 HOKK tokens. Which is equivalent to .0000005 cents or something like that. I dont even believe uniswap would allow me to do a swap for so little. I checked Etherscan to see the transaction and there it says it was about a $240 swap, but still my metamask doesn't reflect that. I tried to log-out and log back in but that didn't seem to work. I also deleted the coin but my metamask and reinstalled it but that also did not work. Have you ever seen something like this? Any help would be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you!",,,,,,

7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-10-30T09:38:43.1990000-04:00,Approval is when you approve the token to be used/spent on Uniswap. Swap is when you actually swap the tokens and transfer them to your connected wallet.,,,,,,
4.93E+17,jakub0781,2021-10-30T09:41:56.8350000-04:00,But shouldnt it be already approved when i bought that token via uniswap few months ago and now I want to sell it?,,,,,,
7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-10-30T09:42:44.3350000-04:00,"https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap gives you the best price across the 2 versions (V2 and V3). So if you previously approved in V3 and the best price is in V2, you will have to approve again and vice versa.

https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?use=V3 will force the UI to use V3,

7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-10-30T09:47:33.5080000-04:00,"But if it's more expensive to do another approval for the other version, then you can just stick to the version you already approved by using the links I sent above to force the swap in V2 or V3.",,,,,,

The gas fees will eat any gains you may have.  The miners need a reality check and soon when hype slows the fees will come down.  The current fee structure is unfair and fueled by inexperienced traders recklessly swapping and moving tokens around.

That is a known issue for fee-on-transfer tokens. You have to account for that fee by increasing the slippage tolerance in the Uniswap interface and only then will your wallet pop up.

Uniswap is also a good portfolio automanagement tool (actually I like balancer more for that since more tokens = more auto management).",,,,,,

I am not sure what did I do wrong here but in the screenshot below it shows the saitama cost $87 (0.01923 ETH) per coin! which is ridiculously so expensive! the Saitama price should be around 0.0000000088 now.

Here is step by step what I did.

Transfer around $180 worth of ETH from coinbase app to coinbase wallet

waited 3-5 mins to let the ETH settle in Coinbase wallet

Navigated to uniswap.org website and click on Launch APP (I did it while I was in Coinbase Wallet.)

Choose Swap from : ETH

Choose Swap to : Saitama (I had to import it for first time)

I noticed that the Saitama price per coin is around 87 dollars as the screenshot below shows. I am not sure what did I do wrong.

Thanks for contacting Coinbase Wallet Support.

At this time, Coinbase Wallet does not have an automatic way to cancel a stuck transaction.

However, if you wish to cancel a stuck transaction, you can do it manually by following these steps:
- Open the stuck transaction details in Etherscan, and note down the nonce.
- Go back to Wallet and send at least $0.01 of ETH to any valid address.
- Select normal or fast as the miner fee options and then replace the nonce in the custom section with the stuck transaction‚Äôs nonce.

Please let us know if you have any further questions.",,,,,,

While I was on uniswap, i could not complete the transaction. Never  could confirm on my phone. Anyway, I thought I would just stop and try later. After I thought I got off uniswap, I looked at my coinbase wallet and in front of my eyes I saw all of my $200 worth of ethereum disappear along with $3200 worth of Saitama Inu. 37 billion plus coins. I lost it all. How do I recover this? Who do I talk with on Uniswap for help.? Any customer service, email or phone number? Very afraid and scared now. I did email coinbase and uniswap . This morning some guy from New York called me representing uniswap and said he needed to get on my laptop to check out any and all transaction and accounts. I did not let hime. I was too suspicious. Can anyone help me. I fear I lost $3400 forever. Please help. I see the trasaction on etherscan and the address my assets went to. I even took pictures.

74 days ago i had 2 transaction on uniswap
i swapped ETH to OOE
first transaction link is here :
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7cab0e9f21ff3d0f6888472aace4beba2627e8e9c4e21f733006d501599ae45b
on this  history (Aug-31-2021 06:28:06 PM +UTC)
ETH Price was : $3,435.17 
OOE Price was: 80 cents 

I spend 2954$  ( 0.86 eth * 3435 = 2954$)
and I get 2100$ ( 2667 OOE * 0.80 = 2100$)

transaction fee was 55$
so I lost about 800 $ here !!!!!



and second transaction link is here :
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x3e767cac365ee73953808fa71552d04a4a8bde182271456a4100a57a787214bd

on this history (Aug-31-2021 06:31:01 PM +UTC)
ETH Price was : $3,435.17 
OOE Price was: 80 cents 

I spend 1,236$  ( 0.36 eth * 3435 = 1,236$)
and I get 724$ ( 905 OOE * 0.80 = 724$)

transaction fee was 49$
so I lost about 436$ here !!!!!


436+800= 1236 

I lost 1236 $

1.We'll need to remove the current token imported in your Uniswap UI. Do this with the token lists off, then clear Uniswap cookies and site history

    1. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser
    2. Click on the output token > Manage token list > Tokens
    3. Click the trashcan icon next to the Saitama token
    4. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser

then you will have to add the token again. When you type the token in it shouldn't come up, and you will have to use the token address

I would click Swap and a pop up would come up and say ""waiting for confirmation, go to your wallet to confirm,"" but it would never bring up my wallet, and would just send me back to the original screen (the one where you choose your coin and amount). I then put all the Etherium on to a metamask account and it would continue to do the same. I can't seem to figure this out, am I doing something wrong? Or is there a glitch that I do not know about",,,,,,

I‚Äôve been trying to cash my Saitama out for some time and every process I do doesn‚Äôt work, if anyone can me help with trying to cash my Saitama out of MetaMask please let me know. But I just tried doing it through uniswap (Saitama to ETHEREUM) the confirmation went through on uniswap end but when I looked at the transaction on MetaMask end, it took all of my ETH as a fee, and never swapped my Saitama over to ETH on MetaMask.  What am I doing wrong and how can I get my money back? 
P.s I did through mobile phone and laptop

I'm considering releasing 1-5% of the token supply at a time into the liquidity pool and waiting for some people to buy and trade it to hopefully promote a better distribution.",,,,,,

1.We'll need to remove the current token imported in your Uniswap UI. Do this with the token lists off, then clear Uniswap cookies and site history

1.We'll need to remove the current token imported in your Uniswap UI. Do this with the token lists off, then clear Uniswap cookies and site history

    1. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser
    2. Click on the output token > Manage token list > Tokens
    3. Click the trashcan icon next to the Saitama token
    4. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser

then you will have to add the token again. When you type the token in it shouldn't come up, and you will have to use the token address

So if I could see the actual gas consumption (in gwei) of the smart contract, I could do the math with current eth prices... is there not a way to see this? For instance if I want to swap PAXG for USD, I know I'd be routed through two contracts, and I guess I could look at PAXG to ETH and ETH to USD and estimate myself. Just thinking out loud here.

5.56E+17,only_hardcore,2021-11-25T14:47:11.5580000-05:00,"Hello everyone!
I wanted to swap USDT in POLS, I had previously sent 1000 USDTto my METAMASK on Ethereum network to complete the transaction.
I forgot about the commissions on the exchange at ETX ...
Please tell me how much will be the estimated commission in ETH to swap 1000 USDT? Because in my METAMASK due to the lack of ETH funds to pay the commission - the amount of the commission itself is not displayed (only the inscription ""you do not have enough funds to pay for gas""

Or, perhaps there is some other way to change USDT into ETH (swap) by paying a commission using USDT?

Sorry if stupid questions.

Sincerely!
Thanks!",,,,,,

The first time you do a swap *from* a particular token, you need to do 2 transactions. 

**Step 1** is the `Approve`. This basically just unlocks the token for you to use it in Uniswap and no swap happens in this step. Approves are part of the ERC-20 standard, so it's required. NOTE: Each token requires a different Approval for each Uniswap version (V1, V2, or V3). 

**Step 2** is the `Swap`. This is where your tokens are actually swapped for something else. 

Note: **Both** `Approve` and `Swap` transactions will cost you fees, just like any other transaction in Ethereum.",https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597638926152499206/914236953057185802/Approve__Swap.PNG?ex=65f5f383&is=65e37e83&hm=68905485fa6afa4b61c2d20804bdfb16f74ac28e872e82313f891e63c4e5880a&,,,,,

**Step 1** is the `Approve`. This basically just unlocks the token for you to use it in Uniswap and no swap happens in this step. Approves are part of the ERC-20 standard, so it's required. NOTE: Each token requires a different Approval for each Uniswap version (V1, V2, or V3).

I made this transaction at 25/11/2021 through your swap website /   the internet was bad / and I did connect my wallet to UNISWAP . then when doing the swap I did not know what happened but you automatically took the tokens from my wallet without paying for it so I am still waiting for you to pay for it and send the USDT to my wallet 0xf4A82d90bb54ED18F0e522445d04B763e18FC8C1

when you enter into a liquidity pool you earn your percentage of fees for the range you select, From Both tokens in the pool.

Look for price differences between the DEX and CEXs. For example, at the time of writing, the BTC price of DFI at an exchange like Bittrex is 0.00002643 BTC per DFI. Compared to Bittrex, the price of BTC in the DEX is 0.00002522 BTC per DFI. **BTC is more expensive at the DEX than Bittrex.**  <----

Then sell the 1 BTC for 39,355.98845598 DFI on the DEX, for a profit of 768.37237961 DFI ‚Ä?about 2% for a single day.

8.64E+17,Roy | VOYA#2589,2021-12-15T08:04:20.8910000-05:00,"So based on the above I understand that IF slippage is lower than your slippage tolerance - you would still be 'charged' the full slippage tolerance.

8.26E+17,undoubted08,2021-12-15T08:08:35.4970000-05:00,"No, slippage would mean the allowable loss you are willing to take of the value of the token you will be receiving.",,,,,,
8.64E+17,Roy | VOYA#2589,2021-12-15T08:18:53.3570000-05:00,"Yes, thanks. That I understand. May be that I'm a bit slow here. Let's take the following example:

I'm accepting to trade 10 token X for 1000 token Y. I put my slippage tolerance at 2% and the actual slippage turns out to be 0.2%. (lets only look at slippage for this example). 

Would the trade outcome be 10X for 998Y (i.e., 0.2% slippage) OR 10X for 980Y (i.e., the slippage tolerance of 2%). If the latter is the case, what happens with the difference between the 0.2% being the actual slippage and the max tolerance of 2% (i.e., 18Y tokens in this case).",,,,,,

We'll need to remove the current token imported in your Uniswap UI. Do this with the token lists off, then clear Uniswap cookies and site history

    1. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser
    2. Click on the output token > Manage token list > Tokens
    3. Click the trashcan icon next to the `Saitama` token
    4. After that, do a refresh through the menu of your browser

Then you will have to add/import the token again. When you type the token in it shouldn't come up as readily imported, and you will have to use the token address

There is no way to avoid paying the ETH gas fees. I have MATIC in my Coinbase wallet on the etherium blockchain. In order to use the Polygon integration, I must use Polygon's token bridge to bring my MATIC onto the Polygon network (which costs ETH gas fees), only then can I swap my MATIC on the Polygon chain. Is there something I'm missing? seems like there's no way to escape paying the ETH gas fees...",,,,,,
7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-12-24T04:10:59.2570000-05:00,"Yes, you still need to pay gas fees in ETH if you will use the bridge.

7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-12-24T04:19:47.7100000-05:00,If your tokens are in Ethereum you cannot use it in Polygon unless you bridge it over to Polygon which will cost you gas fees in ETH.,,,,,,
6.15E+17,cletusaurus,2021-12-24T04:26:23.5410000-05:00,"Thanks for sticking with me, so this integration between of Polygon on Uniswap does not solve the ETH gas fee problem? Many crypto youtubers are marketing this as a way for the retail investor to trade without ETH gas fees. From what you are saying, it sounds like in order to make a swap from an external wallet or exchange,  I must first transfer to the Polygon Mainnet using the bridge, even if the token is MATIC itself... which uses the Bridge... meaning i must pay ETH gas fees.",,,,,,
6.15E+17,cletusaurus,2021-12-24T04:32:35.5330000-05:00,"And the only way this would be better than what it was previously (without polygon integration) is that with the Polygon integration, you no longer need to pay ETH gas fees for every swap. You need to pay them once to convert to the Polygon network (ETH gas)  -> do swapping  (MATIC gas) -> convert back to ETH network (more ETH gas). So if you plan to make only one swap, there is no added benefit. Correct?",,,,,,
8.32E+17,PurpleFlame#3827,2021-12-24T04:34:47.9490000-05:00,Coinbase and other cex's will allow off ramps directly to polygon and other l2's in the future. Which sidesteps the L1>L2 fees. But right now there are still some UX issues with using L2 from L1.,,,,,,
7.46E+17,cindylo0,2021-12-24T04:34:48.5400000-05:00,"Bridging assets from Ethereum to Polygon will definitely cost you gas fees in ETH but using Uniswap in Polygon to swap, add liquidity, remove liquidity is cheaper compared to Ethereum fees.",,,,,,
6.15E+17,cletusaurus,2021-12-24T04:45:28.4500000-05:00,"Okay, thanks for both of your help. One last question, for clarity, It seems my interpretation of what the Polygon integration could do was initially incorrect - in order to use the Polygon network, you must use the bridge -- meaning that you pay the same gas fees as you would without the Polygon integration? -- therefore, this does not solve the ETH gas fees issue for the retail investor... until Centralized exchanges allow off ramps directly to polygon.",,,,,,
