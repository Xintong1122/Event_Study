BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat 
www.binance.com/en/chat",,,
8.85E+17,MEE6,2022-01-06T19:00:26.0600000-05:00,"‚ùóÔ∏è Important Reminder ‚ùóÔ∏è

‚ù?There is NO official Binance Customer Support on Discord.

‚õîÔ∏è Anyone that claims to be Binance Customer Service and messages you first in a private message is a scammer. If anyone asks you to send money to any address, they are also trying to scam you and should be ignored. Please report these users immediately.

üòá Our Binance Angels are moderators of this server and can point you to the right resources, but they don't provide technical support. Angels will not PM you first. Beware of imposters.

In 2019, I met @KeilahGularte, a person who would become very special in my life. As time went by, we fell in love and the feeling of affection and love continued to grow. But at the time both of us didn't have a job. We started dating even though we lived in different cities. Despite being physically distant, we always managed to talk and interact, whether by phone calls or video calls.

We didn't met often, therefore, every second was special. We struggled a lot so that, one day, we could be closer. After much study and dedication, in October of last year, I managed to be approved and selected to work at a public department in the city where she lives in. This helped us getting closer.

As we were always sure how we felt about each other, it was not difficult to decide that we will get married later this year, but a beautiful wedding comes with many costs. Also, in the last four months I have had and still have a lot of expenses as I moved and I am furnishing an apartment to live in and this ended up consuming practically all my savings.

Now, more than ever, we are certain that we will spend the rest of our lives together, and that is why #MyCryptoWish is: achieving a beautiful wedding worthy of the love and affection I have for @KeilahGularte.

I hope that #Binance enables us to make this dream come true. üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª",,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat

Wanna send some ETH to my metamask wallet. In order to save gas fees I'd like to use the BEP20 network (Binance Smart Chain). Would that work? 

I already tested sending a tiny amount - got confirmed on the binance side. But didn't receive the amount in metamask by now (several hours back now). 

Fees on the ERC20 network would around 20 USD whereas BEP are only a few cents.

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
and this one for contact the support
To contact the support :
From the web version click on the chat icon at the bottom right of your screen or on ""Online Support"" for the Desktop application
On the mobile application, go to your profile (top left) then: Help & Support and finally chat.
Below is the procedure to use the livechat:

‚ö†Ô∏èSupport is not a bot, to be connected with an agent :
1Ô∏è‚É£ select the category that matches your problem or the one that is closest to it, 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Specify that your issue is not resolved by clicking the thumbs down
3‚É£Press quit if more questions that do not match your problem appear
4‚É£Leave a message that describes your problem it will be forwarded to support, no need to SPAM, one message is enough!

No Admin/Angel will contact you directly

The only way to contact support is through livechat

7.63E+17,godotsancho,2022-01-29T06:25:54.9240000-05:00,"May I ask, what will bDOT be? For example, open other trading pairs, allowing market arbitrage, or can withdraw cash to participate in the  DeFi? 
The current 1 bDOT exchange 0.61 DOT, the actual price of $11.5, the actual gap from the current DOT price 11.5 * 1.62% = $18.63. That means that the conversion to bDOT, through the coin vote, is going to lose 62%.

So could it be possible to.
1. open up bDOT other trading pairs to allow users to arbitrage and hedge the spread.
2. open up bDOT withdrawals to allow users to participate in DeFi on the boca chain.
3. let market makers bridge the spread, 20% discount, in fact, is still acceptable, 62% is really unacceptable.

Currently, bDOT can only be used to exchange DOT slot auction liquidity, and can only accept the exchange of the dump. In this case, the spread will get bigger and bigger. All depends on what spread the market maker is willing to use to pick up, a little too unfriendly to users.",,,

BEWARE OF SCAMS! There is no Binance Customer Service on Discord/telegram, and no admin/angel will contact you directly. 

No crypto transfer will be requested from you.

üî∏How to recognize the account of an official Binance Angel/Admin:üî∏
1Ô∏è‚É£You will NEVER be contacted first
2Ô∏è‚É£We are not support, someone who contacts you privately claiming to be a part of it is a SCAM
3Ô∏è‚É£We will never ask you for personal info or money transfer

Be sure you know who you are talking to and never share any personal info, the only info the angels are likely to ask you for is your ticket numbers and your Binance ID. If in doubt, don't hesitate to ask on this channel for confirmation.
We also do not give signals - investment advice or paid training on cryptos.
And finally there is no Binance support on Telegram/Discord!

You can also disable DM from this group by doing a right click on the Binance server icon -> Privacy Settings-> disable DMs on this server
