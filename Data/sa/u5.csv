By removing them from uniswap UI or..?

> Smart contracts using AMM spot prices as oracles can be easily exploited through sandwich attacks ‚Ä?an attack vector where a malicious entity makes a large trade within an AMM liquidity pool to shift the price in their favor, then uses that distorted pricing to unfairly siphon value from smart contracts using that AMM liquidity pool as a spot price oracle. Normally, such an attack would only be possible by well-capitalized entities like whales, but flash loans allow anyone in the world to become a temporary whale and perform such a sandwich attack.",,,,

4.78861E+17,vaderresearch,2021-07-24T19:00:56.3990000-04:00,But then you need to have the information that the other guys will definitely buy from this pool right? So you basically frontrun them. Otherwise any rational trader who sees the price would just trade from a CEX no?,,,,
2.33787E+17,_mustached,2021-07-24T19:01:31.1530000-04:00,Yes sandwhichers frontrun trades by observing the mempool and bribing a miner to put their transactions before and after the trade waiting in the mempool,,"Uni (1),üôè (1)",,
4.78861E+17,vaderresearch,2021-07-24T19:21:38.1870000-04:00,"Let‚Äôs say I submit an order to buy ETH at $2k from the ETH/USDT pool on Uniswap. To pay lower gas fees, I want the transaction to get executed in 1min. Let‚Äôs assume that the pool has low TVL and that you, a sandwich attacker, have enormous capital. You learn that I have submitted the transaction and before it‚Äôs executed, you submit a massive order buying half the pool and spiking up ETH price to $20k in the pool. You pay a high gas fee to the miner so that the transaction is executed ASAP. Now, my ETH order is executed at $20k. Then you sell all the ETH you bought. How do you make a profit from this? What is your weighted average cost and your weighted average selling price?

Can‚Äôt I avoid this by setting up a max slippage or paying high gas fees so the transaction is executed faster?
What if I don‚Äôt have enough USDT to buy ETH at $20k? Wouldn‚Äôt your strategy fail?
How do you know that I submitted an order? Do you see it in the mempool in Etherscan?",,,,

The app isn't the uniswap protocol, it is fully runned by uniswap labs (the app) and the governance has nothing to say about it.
The governance owns `uniswap.eth` and could propose it's own app if it wish too but it hasn't currently done anything.
Many people have forked the app, and just removed all the restrictions, all of thoses restrictions are just done in your browser, the actual uniswap protocol on chain isn't censorable (like not at all, even the governance couldn't vote to censor anything in the protocol).

Other apps such as zapper, 1inch or paraswap which may access uniswap under the hood works perfectly fine and have no restrictions (except if they implemented some themself which I don't belive they do).",,"üëç (1),üòÄ (1)",,

Uniswap is made by uniswap labs (a small US based company).
They have been paid a lots of money from the ethereum fundation at first.
And now owns a lot of UNI, so their incentives are to make uniswap better and hope that this makes UNI more expensive, so they could sell some UNI at a better price in the future.

The main incentives behind banning some tokens are tiny legal things, (such as not going to prison, or not receiving a lawsuit from the SEC or FCC because they are selling unofficial securities, ...). And remember that this is only for `app.uniswap.org` you are completely free to download uniswap's interface source code, remove the ban list, and build it, it takes ~10 minutes and you will have 0 bans or just use an other version from someone which already made this.",,üëç (1),,

What has happen is that coinbase did a swap doing `RSR -> USDC`, but the `USDC / RSR` pool is really really tiny so it loose all of his money to price impact and arb bots.
Uniswap's UI would never have made that trade, uniswap's UI would have made `RSR -> ETH -> USDC` likely, and have a price impact of ~1% (not ~99.9%).
The smart contract doesn't check for this kind of routing stuff because it's just too expensive and would cost too much gas. This task is delegated to the UI, but coinbase's UI doesn't do that.",,üëç (3),,

The WBTC-USDC pool currently has 48.57m in total value locked and generated 44,720 in fees in the last 24 hours. I'm dividing the fees by the total value locked (and get 0.0009207) to get the percentage gain over those 24 hours. I add 1 to this (1.0009207), giving me the daily multiplier that came from trading fees accruing. And I raise it to the 365th power to repeat this process for a whole year. This comes to an APY of 40.4%. This seems way too high, does anyone have an idea as to what's going on here? Thanks!",,,,

I don't agree with this, be able to take tokens off the platform is form of centralisation and centralisation is bad.
Nobody forces to buy tokens, you can just not buy scam / bad tokens.

The issue is that there is no good only control.

So for example in V3 you can have lots of ETH resisting a price drop but few tokens so a price raise would be easy.

But yes in V2 more tokens in the pool, (without more ETH to compensate) would just make the price lower.",,,,

Something other industry's do well is arming people with information to help them craft a message to their representatives/senators. I was hoping the Crypto Council would have this but I couldn't find anything similar. Below is the message I sent to all of my representatives/Senators, feel free to send this on and hopefully it helps:

Ma'am,

I would ask you to confer with your fellow Senators and remove the crypto portions of the infrastructure bill. First, crypto policy has no place in an infrastructure bill. It deserves its own bill that can stand on its own and not be grouped together. Second, the portions inside the bill are completely unrealistic to enact and would erode momentum that the United States currently has in becoming a leader in the crypto world and continuing our leadership in the financial sector instead of ceding ground to China and other nations that do not respect human rights or the rest of our freedom-loving values. If the Senate does not remove this portion from the bill, you vote against the infrastructure bill. Last, I would ask you to talk to Senator Warren about crypto. I take offense to being called a ""shadowy super coder."" I have served honorably in the US military for more than a decade, and many in the crypto world want to build crypto to be a more transparent financial system than the current financial system we have. We also believe it will open access to funding and banking to many who don't have that access today. I highly recommend you and Senator Warren listen to the Bankless podcasts, weekly rollup, released each Friday to learn more about crypto.",,,,

Few days ago I logged into Uniswap with my Fortmatic Account... 

0x71E000D7F5d6B221EBaA5f8d7553690724a84889

I was able to see 1.035.. ETH as the balance on the opening screen of Uniswap beneath the ETH (dropdown menu for currency selection - unfortunaty, I don't have a screen shot showing those ETH). A few days ago, I tried to explore some features like swap, pool, vote, etc. but I never completed those transactions. 

Surprisingly when I logged in with this wallet today, all ETH balance is gone. 

FYI, I have some MATICs in the same wallet too. Since, I wasn't able to login with this wallet with the MATICs on Cargo, I had to be in touch with Fortmatic Discord. 

Do you think 0 ETH is now shown on Uniswap due to any changes in my Formatic default setting by Fortmatic team? How can I revive that Balance 1.035...ETH? 

If possible, Can you pl transfer those 1.035.. ETH to my 
wallet? 0xf399cC83CFDC5DC3175a72D6230D0c8c86B50147

Hello Andrew,

Thank you for reaching out to Coinbase Support. If you are experiencing issues related to the function of a specific Dapp we recommend reaching out to the Dapp developer directly as we cannot provide troubleshooting steps for Dapps.

We believe the smart contract allowing swaps on Uniswap is routing funds from swaps to another address and/or not properly swapping the correct amount.

Here is the transaction hash in question.
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x507f905914460346b267eeda19e9bd730531cf63992eae5a03891a8c22196466

Please take a look at the 'Transaction Action' and 'Tokens Transferred' for further details regarding this transaction.

It looks like the the majority of the funds remained in the Uniswap V2 pool after the swap occurred.

We hope this information helps explain the situation.

Thanks,
Coinbase Support",,,,

To visualize what's going on, I queried the data from the GraphQL API and used Gephi to create the network visualization of UniSwap. The edges are token pairs (liquidity pools) and the nodes are tokens. I also made the node sizes proportional to how many pools they're in (the big one in the bottom left is Ether).

So I haven't followed Uniswap too closely recently and trying to update myself on the following two topics.

> Fee Sharing
Since this has been voted in for v2.
Is this live? 
Do you need to stake UNI anywhere to receive a revenue cut in fees?
In case it's live, where can I find statistics on return?


> Liquidity Mining for v3
So projects can now incentice there own pools on v3 afaik.
Again, is this live?
Is there a tool that shows what projects are incentivizing what Uni v3 pools currently?

Thanks in advance",,,,

I have been steakd by UniSwap and UNI-V2 and have not been migrated yet.
However, a message came in that I was designated as a solver and requested synchronization of related materials and specific sites.
I believed and did what I wanted, but the first synchronization site was repeatedly disassembled and then I informed another synchronization site and synchronized it

ETH COIN has slipped out of my wallet before that and I can not even get in touch.

I think there are a lot of frauds even in this inside, who should I ask for a solution?

Sometimes a message comes in saying UniSwap support, I don't know if I should believe it.",,,,

No that was just bad architecture design.
Also some people make it sounds like it's new, no it's not, we have seen this attack already, it's just that it was done on multisigs / upgrade proxy, not on a runner contract like that, but not many peoples have created thoses kinds of contracts already so it's expected.",,,,

- Test your code, a lot
- Make other people review your code.
- And write ""secure by design"" thing, so for example something that have powers must be very restrained. So for example, don't give admin powers to a contract that is meant to execute random transactions from strangers on the internet.",,,,

No, if you see this that a scam.
A new airdrop would need get voted by the governance, the governance is everyone holding UNI.

1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-14T10:41:48.9220000-04:00,"The ratio is calculated by the range.
So if you choose a range you need to follow the ratio of that range.
But you can change the range to change the ratio.
If you want to spend 0 USDC and only your token, you can create a range like this:
```
- Current price 100$
- Range start 101$ (or anything above the current price)
- Range end 5000$ (or anything above the start of the range)
```
In practice people will be able to buy your token, but not sell it.
Note that if some peoples buy your token, this will exchange some of your token to USDC in the pool (that what swapping is in reality), so your token will be sellable using the newly USDC found in the pool.",,üëç (1),,

**Step 2** is the `Swap`. This is where your tokens are actually swapped for something else. 

**Note:** You are **charged** an Ethereum transaction fee a.k.a. gas fees each for **both** the `Approve` and `Swap`, just like any other transaction in Ethereum.

Then after say a month of trading (let's ignore any other liq. providers adding/removing liquidity) the fees that have been paid in make the LP worth more than it was a month ago. The Uniswap platform shows this profit on the accounts page, under positions. If I add more liquidity to the same pool will I get a new position for the same pair, or will the platform merge it into the same position? The reason I ask is, it wouldn't be simple at that point to calculate total fees earned, as the LP was acquired at different times - essentially the LP had a different ""price"" so how could you calculate the profit?",,,,

7.43034E+17,chinca#2121,2021-08-17T11:38:23.3060000-04:00,"eth is the only currency accepted to pay for gas, and gas fees are paid to miners",,,,
3.9451E+17,confused6312,2021-08-17T11:39:41.0810000-04:00,Well uni is not the only exchange paying fees to the miners. If i trade in any other exchange they cut the fees directly from the currency i want to trade. Is there an option which i can choose?,,,,
7.43034E+17,chinca#2121,2021-08-17T11:41:14.4500000-04:00,like what exchange? there is no other token required to pay for gas except for eth if you are trading tokens in in the ethereum network,,,,
3.9451E+17,confused6312,2021-08-17T11:43:49.7770000-04:00,"I think i cant explain my self. For example if i want to swap some erc20 token on bitpanda to eth, they dont require me to hold eth to trade a token to eth. They cut the fees from the token i am trading. On uniswap if i want to trade umx to eth i need extra eth on my trustwallet to swap it. I am swapping it already to eth but they require to hold more eth for uniswap to get eth in return.

When I went to add the token to my MetaMask wallet to see the new tokens the tokens weren't there. When I went to check the transaction on Etherscan, the contract number for the DEXT tokens is different than the contract number on CoinGecko for the same DEXT tokens. When I add the contract number on Etherscan to MetaMask to see the tokens I bought, it is a different icon and they do not look the same. Can I get the correct DEXT tokens in my wallet or reverse the transaction?  When I look at the Etherscan transaction, the token says it's DEXTools and has the official DEXTools website as the official website of the token. I was trying to buy the token with contract # 0xfb7b4564402e5500db5bb6d63ae671302777c75a but instead uniswap sold me the token with contract # 0x26ce25148832c04f3d7f26f32478a9fe55197166. Normally, I would just immediately sell them back and get my money back but the 4777 DEXT tokens that it gave me for 0.35 ETH in the transaction are immediately now worth 0.006 ETH which is $18 instead of the $1000 I just spent on them.",,,,

You don't need an ERC20, I understand it makes your work a few multiplications and divisions.
But if you don't let users borrow positions of others you can just limit each user to X position maximum (or require an additional deposit that will be lost uppon liquidation per new position) to avoid users creating a gas deadlock and just use the V3 NFT positions and for each position fetch what is the current value at time of liquidation.",,,,

But Im thinking another approach would be to ""wrap"" somehow the NFT positions to make them behave more like an ERC20? The reason I need it as ERC20 is because it coexists with other assets in a pool, all ERC20 so I really want them to have that behavior (but underneath could be V3 Uniswapt NFT positions). Do you see this feasible?",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:33:34.3840000-04:00,"You can't wrap things that doesn't have the same value (or rather you can't wrap things that have values that doesn't scale the same way).
Imagine creating a wrapped token that contains WBTC and WETH.",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:34:52.9010000-04:00,"@Julian Rodriguez I really think if you want V3, either you use an automated liquidity managment (which aren't that good and doesn't allows cool stuff such as sell order margin trading) and an ERC20. Or accept that V3 is hard and write some snow flake code for uniswap V3.",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:38:30.8510000-04:00,"What I mean, is let's assume you allow USDT, WETH and WBTC in your platform.
When someone wants to deposit an NFT, first you check it's an official uniswap one, and what are the tokens, if both tokens are in your token list then you accept the NFT and then you treat the NFT as it's own custom token.
So when someone try to liquidate, you fetch how much underlying the NFT is worth, calculate health factor with thoses new tokens if that bellow your threashold, allow liquidation.

The issue with this is that someone could create 2000 NFTs borrow a lot, and then imagine the price of the NFTs falls down compared to the collateral this would be unliquidatable due to a gas cost too high. So then you can do like what Liquity does, ask users to stake 300$ per new NFT, so when someone liquidate that NFT he would get the extra 300$ to repay the gas costs.",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:39:44.1860000-04:00,"(actually X$ gas costs can't work because liquidations are each O(N) on number of NFTs, and there must be N liquidation per NFT at worst so it's `O(N*2)` where N = number of NFT)",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:39:53.8250000-04:00,so you must just accept to limit at X NFTs per vault,,,,

6.72427E+17,julianmrodri,2021-08-20T08:41:02.1190000-04:00,Yeah I see the implications,,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:41:33.9470000-04:00,"@Julian Rodriguez Honnestly even if I can only have one NFT per vault I don't care I'll likely use your platform.
I can create seperated vault for my USDT / WETH and WBTC / WETH position it's not the end of the world üôÇ
But having 2 or 3 NFTs will leave gas costs likely fine (if you require liquidators to take all or nothing to avoid quadratic gas costs) and allows for bit more complex strategies.",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:46:21.2000000-04:00,"@Julian Rodriguez The only scalling issue with my solution is that will require liquidators to track the evolution of many NFTs (because there can up to `3 * number of vault` NFTs), but since this is running offchain I don't think that is actually an issue.",,üëç (1),,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:50:59.5780000-04:00,"@Julian Rodriguez Ah also this make impossible (or really really hard and costy) to have different strategies of your protocol depending of the total colletaralisation ratio.
Example Liquidity has a mode where if the total collateralisation ratio falls under 150% people that were above the 110% they set are liquidatable anyway (so for example you are at 120% it's fine, but the total is 140% so you gets liquidated anyway).
That wouldn't be possible because you would need to update the NFT price of everyone to calculate the total (I guess you could make that better by keeping tracks of ticks on the liquidity range like the uniswap pool does, that would change the scalling on the number of ticks crossed +1 since the last actuallisation of the pool, instead of the number of NFTs, but you would need to implement the same calculations as uniswap V3 in your protocol to do that, plus if lots of ticks get crossed that still lots of calculations).",,,,
1.83309E+17,jorropo,2021-08-20T08:52:12.4620000-04:00,"@Julian Rodriguez Ah and also, you need to be carefull with the pools, check that someone isn't manipulating the price of the NFTs (someone could sandwitch your protocol, making the price really high so lots of NFTs would become liquidatable, but that is classical oracle safety stuff)",,,,

q1: If I provide liquidity in the range of $20 -> $30, and the price goes from $25 to $35, do I only collect fees as the price rises from $25 to $35? 
q2: As soon as the price passes $30, is all of my liquidity one token?

2. So if it passes $30 you'll stop earning fees and your assets will be converted into one side of the pair.

When a transaction happens, it starts where the price currently is and then maximizes out the liquidity in each tick until all the supplied tokens for the transactions are completed? I hope this is understandable
q5: How does concentrated liquidity multiplier work? I get how it works in theory, but how does $100 over all prices vs $100 liquidity between a price of $3000 and $3500 change the power? I understand that it is only deployed there, but is it 5x more powerful or 1800x more powerful, and if so, how are these calculation of the multiplier performed?

Step 1 is the Approve. This makes it so you can swap that token on Uniswap. From then on, you can swap from that token with only one step. 

Step 2 is the Swap. This is where your tokens are actually swapped for something else. 

Note: You are charged an Ethereum transaction fee each for both the Approve and Swap, just like any other transaction in Ethereum.

You can go back to https://app.uniswap.org/ to proceed with step 2. You should no longer see the Approve button now, just Swap.",,,,

In uniV2 if I was the only LP for token A & B and I was LPIng 2 dollars worth of A&B, it would be impossible for someone to come through and buy 1 dollar of A regardless of how much B they used because of the curve/slippage. If that is a true statement does it also apply to uniV3. I know that Uni V3 you can set a range along the curve which effectively acts as a limit sell or buy. I'm curious what happens if you are the only LP. Same secenario where you are LPing 2 dollars worth of A&B. Can you set the range where someone can completely buy all the A with B with minimal slippage?",,,,

Idk, I would love to answer this question, but I can't because binance is centralised it's not possible for people like you and me to audit them.
(while if you want you can audit uniswap right now yourself, everything you need to know is public (*if you know what you are doing, obviously, if you don't know solidity that will be hard to get anywhere sadly*))

What I know is that many people use their services and almost everyone knows them in the cryptocurrency market, they are here from a long time (which is good).
But I also know that they have very misleading comunication habits, and copy everything popular in DeFi but centralised, with worst rates and they take the fees (which is bad).

I think it's a good company but they prefer steering their clients into their product to make more money rather than proposing a fair comparision of services (which is not something they are forced to do, they want to make more money it's understandable), they are also more expensive (or have lower APR which is the same thing) than other services.
I think you just need to understand that they are not your friend, and are not here to make you win easy money, they are here to win money (like everyone else), and for whatever they propose if you search a bit you can find most of time better options (except for entry fees (*most of the time*), they have really low fees to enter a stake for example, where ethereum can take 100$ of gas fees, they will probably take <1$) and everytime they say something, you have to decode it yourself to see the way more truthfull reality than what they are saying.",,,,

For example if Solana took over. Would UNI be able to easily move over to the new blockchain? In this event would investors lose their capital in the ETH version of the token? Or would there be some sort of 1:1 airdrop for the new version of the token on the Solana network? Trying to get my head around the potential risks of ETH being overtaken. Thanks for any help,,,,

> Are there any L2 Uniswap protocols that support all liquidity pairs on V3 yet?
no, that just is not possible for current L2s, there is no automatic links between uniswap L1 and L2. To have liquidity on L2 you need people to move their money there add liquidity there. So unless someone decide to put a huge part of their money and just buy tokens on L1, bridge to L2 and create all the same pools. This will never happen.
For this to happen we would need trustless sharding which is also called ETH 2.0

So you must first approve the token then spend it, that is how ERC20 has been designed.

In the code, you call `token.approve(uniswapRouter, MAX)` this then allow uniswap to call `token.transferFrom(yourAcount, RecipientPool, tradeValue)`, this will transfer some `token` from your account to the pool (while if uniswap were to call `token.transfer` which doesn't require approval first, it would attempt to transfer from uniswap router's account to the pool which doesn't make sense).",,,,

4.71358E+17,crypto_rachel,2021-09-21T12:34:50.4560000-04:00,"gas fees are the price relative to the work the miners do. The gwei price  multiplied by the amount of data is the transaction cost. So the Gass limit is the amount of work that is being done in the tx (which changes based on the contract). The gas Gwei is the cost for that transactions speed and determines if the miners will accept it. This is based off of network traffic and race conditions to get the tx mined fastest.  better descriptions can be found at ethereum.org
