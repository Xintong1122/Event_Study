If you want to take 3x eth leverage say, using MakerDao (put eth collateral, get dai, swap for eth, put more eth collateral, get dai, swap for more eth, etc.) then you would pay a lot of gas, so you can use flashswaps instead. Flashloans wouldn't work in this case because you would say borrow all the eth you need, deposit in maker-vault, and then have to use uniswap anyways to swap the dai for eth to repay the flashloan, so you would still incur the 0.3% uniswap fees, on TOP of the 0.09% flashloan fees.",,,,,,

I'm new to UniSwap. Apologies if my question sounds trivial.
Currently, it seems in UniSwap, you do 1 to 1 exchange, meaning that you exchange one token for the other.
My question is that can we do 1 to many and many to 1 exchange? Meaning that I would be able to exchange my token for a basket of tokens, or exchange my basket of tokens for a single token.

Thanks for your help in advance.",,,,,,

I saw there is also something that will calculate the optimal route as well.
Question: If I create my own liquidity pool, is it automatically available, in the case that it creates an optimal route between two other tokens? Is it registered on a public registry, or do people actually have to know about it to use it?
(Yeah, I know people can watch transactions, this is aside from that)

Another way to looking at it. Let's say I have a token ""ABC"" and I create a liquidity pool to USDC, and another to DAI. If one of my pools is misbalanced (arbitrage) and provides a better price to buy DAI, would somebody swapping USDC - DAI automatically take advantage of that arbitrage by going through my token?",,,,,,

I bought ERC20 through Uniswap swapping Ethereum for ERC20 on December 29th, January 1 and January 5th. Etherscan.io shows my address as the #26 largest holder of the token (you can find my address there and see my transactions for ERC20). Okay so I really dont know where to start my question. The main concern is that the total US Dollar value spent was right at $5,000. The price of ERC20 is higher now than my average paid by over 50% so my tokens should be worth $7500 you would think...yet when I do a hypothetical sell in uniswap to gauge the value, it is only showing my ERC20 tokens being worth $1700. Any ideas or can anyone point me in the right direction? I private messaged @alexo6103wnagez, who is the creator of the token based out of Ukraine, and he said that Uniswap possibly took commissions from my purchase? First of all, commissions for doing what exactly and if that is the case, the numbers I am seeing on my end would equate to roughly 80% commission taken from my $5,000. Help. Anyone.",,,,,,

just to confirm,
currently TVL is 3.45m and fees in last 24 hrs is $1070
so the annualized yield would be:
(1070/3450000)x365x100=11.32%.
is that correct?",,,,,,
8.28586E+17,heatdeathx,2022-01-13T09:24:55.7960000-05:00,"yes, i think that's correct. you could increase that yield if we take into account of compounding, that the LP collects fees and puts them into the position again. also that the price does not go outside of the range that you LP:ed for. also assumes that the per 24h is $1070 continues

so a lot of small gotchas on what the final yield actually will be afaik, but generally for the pool then it's correct",,,,,,

Here's the CREAM/ETH (1%) pool with trace amounts of dust as TVL. https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x61f6cfa82ae17259fdee34a69ac34702b51b9c00

It has a current price of CREAM as 0.0340 ETH (which it hasn't been for months), while the actual market price is ~0.0225 ETH.

If I would like to provide liquidity between the ranges of 0.025 - 0.04 ETH in a single sided LP of CREAM, I am unable to do so.

The only solution (from what I can understand) would be to swap some ETH for CREAM and then add liquidity after the current price has moved to allow the position to be added.

The downside to that however would be the excessive cost to fix the pool on top of having to add liquidity.

Are there any other potential solutions? Cheers",,,,,,

9.30648E+17,jdpartridge,2022-01-19T12:39:11.3780000-05:00,"I'm new to DeFi. I wanted to share my experience with providing liquidity to a trading pair in Uniswap. Hopefully another newcomer will see this and avoid the mistakes that I made. And hopefully some more seasoned DeFi experts can chime in on the numerous things I did wrong and give advice on how to do it right.

I wanted to get my feet wet by playing with $100 of ETH from my coinbase wallet so I went to Uniswap and swapped $50 ETH for $50 LOOK ---> ~$50 gas fee
I then set up a ETH/LOOK trading pair for approval ---> ~$20 gas fee
Then I added my ETH/LOOK to the liquidity pool with +-10% range ---> ~$120 gas fee
After about 5 hours I made ~$3 (Not bad. At that rate I would recoup my money after 12 days and afford to claim after another 10 days)

The problem: The pair fell out of range because LOOK went up 10% and ETH went slightly down

I now have <$100 of liquidity and ~$3 of earnings to claim but the gas fee is ~$115-$155. Needless to say, I AM NOT CLAIMING IT....

All in all my ""getting my feet wet"" experiment cost me ~$290",,,,,,

9.21611E+17,mthorman,2022-01-20T18:44:58.6970000-05:00,"Also note that you can edit your gas fees to a lower number (at least on MetaMask).  The transaction will just be sitting in the pending state until the gas price drops down to whatever fee you set.  This is nice if you need to make a transaction that isn't time sensitive and you don't want to have to set your alarm clock for the middle of the night when the fees are low.  When editing your gas fee just a couple points to know.

Gas Limit - NEVER change the ""gas limit"" that is automatically there.  This is the amount of gas that is required for a transaction....something like a simple swap will require less gas than minting an NFT.

Max priority fee - this goes to the miner of the block that validates your transaction.  Technically if there are 2 transactions with the same gas amount and different priority fees they will take the higher priority fee.  Typically I might set mine to 3 or 4 GWEI.  (it is only a couple cents difference)

Max Fee - this is where all the change really happens.  You can change this number to whatever amount of gas you want to pay.  But a couple things to keep in mind.  The transaction will be ""stuck"" in pending until the gas price lowers to whatever number you set.  If you set it too low this could mean your transaction is stuck indefinitely.  You also won't be able to make another transaction on the Ethereum Mainnet until the current pending one clears....(although you can always up your gas price later if you need to speed it up).  So back to what number to set your gas price...  Use the Etherscan Gas Tracker linked above and see click the ""historical gas oracle price"" tab part way down.  It will show you a graph with the max, average and low gas price for each day in the last 7 days.  Most days it looks like it hit the 50s for the last week...which is much better than the current 280  I have had pretty good luck with setting the price between 40 and 60 if I am willing to wait for a few days.",,,,,,

My first SWAP was horrible:

I agreed to pay the MAX fee of  0.00456203 ETH ($49.01). This fee is already extreme high for a swapping tool. 

Although I never accepted any higher fee, uniswap took 0.0543923 ($133.77) ! That is about 84 USD more than I agreed. 

How on earth is this possible? How do I get back my 'stolen' money?

Best,

In the following examples, I am supplying single-sided liquidity for a new Token (TKN) which is initially at 1 USDC per TKN, and I am ignoring all trading fees

Example 1:
TKN starts at 1 USDC
Open LP1 (single sided liquidity position) with 100 TKN, range 1 USDC to 2 USDC
TKN does well and sells, now worth 2 USDC
What is LP1 now worth in USDC?

Example 2:
TKN starts at 1 USDC
Open LP1 with 100 TKN, range 1 USDC to 2 USDC
Open LP2 with 100 TKN, range 1 USDC to 10 USDC
TKN increases to 2 USDC
- How much is LP1 worth in USDC?
- How much is LP2 worth in TKN and USDC?
TKN increases further to 10 USDC
- How much is LP2 now worth in USDC?
