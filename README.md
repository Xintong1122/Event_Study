## ðŸ“„ Abstract

In the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency landscape, user trust dynamics shape market behaviors and preferences for centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). The collapse of FTX, a major CEX, marked a critical moment, raising questions about the resilience of centralized trust systems and accelerating shifts toward decentralized alternatives.

This research investigates the immediate and nuanced impacts of the FTX collapse on user trust, focusing on token valuation, trading flows, and sentiment dynamics. Employing robust analytical methods, including Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) and Difference-in-Differences (DID), we reveal significant declines in WETH prices and NetFlow from CEX to DEX, signaling a measurable transfer of trust.

Additionally, topic modeling and sentiment analysis expose the complexities of user responses, highlighting shifts from functional discussions to emotional fragmentation in Binanceâ€™s community, while Uniswapâ€™s sentiment exhibits a gradual upward trend. Despite data limitations and external influences, the findings underscore the intricate interplay between trust, sentiment, and market behavior in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.
